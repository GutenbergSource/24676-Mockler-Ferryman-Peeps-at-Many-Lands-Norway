<h2 class="super">Norway</h2>
<h2 class="label">Chapter I</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Land of the Vikings</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Who has not heard of the Vikings&mdash;the dauntless
sea-rovers, who in the days of long ago were the dread of Northern
Europe? We English should know something of them, for Viking blood
flowed in the veins of many of our ancestors. And these fierce fighting
men came in their ships across the North Sea from Norway on more than
one occasion to invade England. But they came once too often, and were
thoroughly defeated at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, when, as will be
remembered, Harald the Hard, King of Norway, was killed in attempting
to turn his namesake, King Harold of England, off his throne.</p>
<p>Norwegian historians, however, do not say very much about this
particular invasion. They prefer to dwell on the great deeds of another
King Harald, who was called &ldquo;Fairhair,&rdquo; and who began his
reign some two hundred years earlier. This Harald was only a boy of ten
years of age when he came to the throne, but he determined to increase
the size of his kingdom, which was then but a small one, so he trained
his men to fight, built grand new ships, and then began his conquests.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>Norway was at that time divided up into a number of
districts or small kingdoms, each of which was ruled over by an Earl or
petty King, and it was these rulers whom Harald set to work to subdue.
He intended to make one united kingdom of all Norway, and he eventually
succeeded in doing so. But he had many a hard fight; and if the Sagas,
as the historical records of the North are called, speak truly, he
fought almost continuously during twelve long years before he had
accomplished his task, and even then he was only just twenty-one years
of age.</p>
<p>They say that he did all these wonderful things because a girl,
named Gyda, whom he wanted to marry, refused to have anything to say to
him until he had made himself King of a really big kingdom. He made a
vow that he would not comb or cut his hair until he had conquered the
whole country. He led his men to victory after victory, and at length
fought his last great battle at Hafrsfjord (to the south of Stavanger).
The sea-fight was desperate and long, but Harald&rsquo;s fleet
succeeded in overpowering that of the enemy, and Sulki, King of
Rogaland, as well as Erik, King of Hardanger, were slain. Then Harald
cut and dressed his hair, the skalds composed poems in honour of the
event, and for ever after he was known as Fairhair. He was truly a
great Viking, and he did not rest content with the conquest of Norway
alone; for he brought his ships across the North Sea and conquered the
Isle of Man, the Hebrides, the Shetlands, and the Orkneys, and he lived
to the age of eighty-three.</p>
<p>Then there are the stories of the two Olafs&mdash;Olaf Tryggvasson
and Olaf the Saint, each of whom took <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>part in many a fight on
British soil, each of whom was the champion of Christianity in Norway
and fought his way to the throne, and each of whom fell in battle under
heroic circumstances, the one at Svold (A.D. 1000), the other at
Sticklestad (A.D. 1030). To us it is interesting to know that King Olaf
Tryggvasson, on one of his early Viking expeditions, was baptized in
the Scilly Isles, that as his second wife he married an Irish Princess,
and that for some time he lived in Dublin. To the Norwegians he is a
Norse hero of the greatest renown, who during his short reign of barely
five years never ceased to force Christianity on the heathen
population, and who, at the age of thirty-one, came to an untimely end.
His fleet was ambuscaded and surrounded, and when his men had made
their last stand he refused to surrender. Neither would he suffer the
ignominy of capture or death at the hands of his enemies; so, with
shield and sword in hand, and in full armour, he leaped overboard, and
immediately sank. For years afterwards his faithful people believed
that he would appear again, and many fancied that, on occasions, their
hero&rsquo;s spirit visited them.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the old triumphant line, &ldquo;London Bridge is
broken down,&rdquo; yet few are aware that the words are translated
from an old Norse song, and fewer still could say who broke down the
bridge. The story goes that this was accomplished by the other Olaf,
afterwards known as St. Olaf. He and his Vikings had allied themselves
with Etheldred the Unready against the Danes, who held the Thames above
London Bridge. The bridge itself, which in those days was a rough
wooden structure, was densely packed with armed men, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>prepared to
resist the advance of the combined fleets. But Olaf drove his stout
ships against it, made them fast to the piers, hoisted all his sail and
got out his oars, and succeeded in upsetting the bridge into the river,
thus securing victory for Etheldred. But that was before Olaf gained
the throne of Norway. What he did as King of that country would take
too long to tell here. Every district of Norway possesses legends
bearing on his visits when engaged in converting the people to
Christianity, and describing his powers of working miracles. Everywhere
the name of St. Olaf still remains engraven on the country. His death,
however, was that of a soldier&mdash;on the battle-field; and the lance
which Norway&rsquo;s patron saint carried in his last fight may even
now be seen by the altar in Trondhjem Cathedral.</p>
<p>It was St. Olaf&rsquo;s half-brother, Harald the Hard, who fell, as
we have said, at Stamford Bridge, when attempting the invasion of
England in 1066. But all this is history nearly a thousand years old,
and the stirring tales of the Vikings are fully recorded, and may be
read in the Sagas. Ten centuries have changed the order of things.
To-day we have, in our turn, become the invaders, albeit full of peace
and good-will; and over the same seas upon which once danced Long Ship,
Serpent, and Dragon, our great ugly, smoky steamers now plough their
way. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">Chapter II</h2>
<h2 class="main">Modern Norway</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Norroway over the Foam,&rdquo; as it used to be
called, is a good land to go to and a beautiful land to look upon. It
lies less than two days&rsquo; journey from our shores, so it is easy
enough to reach. Away from the towns&mdash;and they are not
many&mdash;everything is picturesque, grand, and majestic, and the
country indeed looks (as the people firmly believed of it long ago) as
if it might have been the playground of countless giants, who amused
themselves by pulling up acres of land, letting the sea into the
valleys, and pelting each other with mountains and islands. Thank
goodness the giants have disappeared! But if they really did have a
hand in fashioning Norway, they are to be congratulated on the
result.</p>
<p>One of the first things one likes to know about a foreign country is
its size. Well, Norway is just a little larger than the British Isles,
and that part of it which forms the usual holiday touring ground of
British and other people&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, from Trondhjem to the
south&mdash;is no larger than England. The remainder of the country
consists of a long, narrow strip running up into the Arctic Circle, and
ending in Lapland in the Far North.</p>
<p>On three sides Norway is washed by the sea; on the other side she
has two neighbours&mdash;Sweden from the south right away up to
Lapland, and then Russia.</p>
<p>Now let us see what sort of a land it is. First, there are the
fjords, stretching often a hundred miles <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>or more inland from the
sea-coast, sometimes with delightful fertile shores, at other times
hemmed in on either hand by rocky cliffs rising two or three thousand
feet sheer from the water. Then there are the mountains, which are
everywhere; for, with the exception of Spain, Norway is the most
mountainous country in Europe. And on their summits lie vast fields of
eternal snow, with glaciers pushing down into the green valleys, or
even into the ocean itself. Again, from these mountains flow down
rivers and streams, now forming magnificent waterfalls as they leap
over the edge of the lofty plateau, now rushing wildly over their
rock-strewn torrent beds, until they reach the lake, which, thus
gathering the waters, send them on again in one wide river to the
fjord.</p>
<p>Such things lend themselves to create scenery which cannot fail to
charm, and in one day in Norway you may see them all. Take, for
instance, the famous view of the N&aelig;rodal from Stalheim, a place
which every visitor to Western Norway knows well. Probably nowhere in
the world is there anything to approach it in grandeur, for not only
are there the great mountains forming the sides of the actual valley in
the foreground, but away beyond appears a succession of other
mountains, stretching far across the Sogne Fjord, even to the snowy
peaks of Jotunheim.</p>
<p>People who live in such a land must needs be proud of it, and the
descendants of the Vikings believe that there exists in the world no
fairer country than their beloved Norge.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e463src" href="#xd26e463" name="xd26e463src">1</a> Maybe they are
not far wrong. But these Northern people are not numerous, and they
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>are not forced, for want of space, to spoil their
landscapes by studding the country-side with little red-brick cottages,
for all Norway contains not one-half the number of inhabitants found in
London. Under such circumstances the feeling of freedom is great, and
the Norwegians claim that, as a nation, they are the freest of the
free. Recent events would seem to justify the claim. Only the other day
Norway dissolved the Union with Sweden with little difficulty, and of
her own free-will cast herself loose from the light fetters with which,
for nearly a century, she considered that she had been bound.</p>
<p>With Norway time has dealt kindly. In modern ages war has not
ravaged her lands. The oldest living Norseman was born too late to
fight for his country, and it is to be hoped that his grandsons and
great-grandsons may continue to live in ignorance of the horrors which
war entails. Yet are they all prepared to take up arms in defence of
hearth and home, for each able-bodied man serves his time as a soldier,
and doubtless, if occasion should arise, would prove to the world that
the old Viking spirit within him was still alive.</p>
<p>It is, however, the sense of restfulness pervading everything that
is Norway&rsquo;s charm, and even the ordinary bustle of life is
unknown outside the towns. In the summer the beaten tracks of the
country are practically in the hands of the foreign visitors, whose
money helps not a little to support many a Norse family. In the winter
things are different, as, except perhaps in Christiania, very few
foreigners are to be met with, and the Norwegians live their own lives.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span></p>
<p>The towns are neither numerous nor large, and, with a few
exceptions, are situated on the sea-coast. Perhaps a quarter of the
whole population of Norway is to be found in the towns, the remainder
consisting of country-folk, who live on their farms. What we term
villages barely exist, and the nearest approach to them is a group of
farms with a church in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Christiania, the capital of the country, is the largest town, and
other towns of importance are Bergen, Trondhjem, Stavanger,
Frederikstad, T&ouml;nsberg, and Christiansand, all busy seaports and
picturesquely situated. But the interest of a country such as Norway
does not lie in the towns, which, with their wide streets, stately
buildings, well-stocked shops, hotels, restaurants, places of
amusement, and crowded dwellings, do not differ very greatly from other
European towns, and a townsman&rsquo;s life in his town is much the
same all over the civilized world.</p>
<p>Town-dwellers in all Norway number no more than the inhabitants of
Manchester, and though force of circumstance necessitates their living
in the towns, their thoughts are ever of the country&mdash;of the
fjeld, the fjord, the forest, the mountain lake, or the salmon river.
In the summer nothing pleases them better than to tramp, with knapsack
on back, for days on end, in the wilderness of the mountains, obtaining
shelter for the night at some out-of-the-way mountain farm or at one of
the snug little huts of the Norwegian Tourist Club. In the winter they
have their sleighs, snow-shoes, toboggans, and skates to assist them in
taking air and exercise, and in a Norwegian winter one does not live in
a state of uncertainty as to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href=
"#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>whether the ice will bear or the snow be
still lying on the ground when one wakes up in the morning.</p>
<p>So comfortable has travelling in Norway been made for foreigners
that there is no difficulty in going anywhere. There is a railway from
Christiania to Bergen, and another from Christiania to Trondhjem. There
are regular steamers on all the fjords and along the coast, even up to
the North Cape and beyond. Wherever there are roads there is a
well-appointed service of vehicles and posting-stations, and wherever
anyone is likely to go by steamer, road, or rail there are hotels.</p>

<h2 class="label">Chapter III</h2>
<h2 class="main">The People and Their Industries</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The greater number of the people are country-folk, who
gain a living by farming, timber-working, or, when living near the sea,
by fishing. Then there are a certain number of men who are soldiers by
profession, and more still who are sailors&mdash;not fighting sailors,
but serving on board the 8,000 merchant vessels which Norway
possesses.</p>
<p>Everyone who lives in a Norwegian town is connected one way or
another with some sort of trade or profession; and, of course, in the
seaports there are always ships coming and going, unloading and
loading, and so providing plenty of work for a great many men. In the
towns also there are, as in every civilized town, men who follow
regular professions&mdash;clergymen, merchants, bankers, lawyers,
doctors, hotel-keepers, shop-keepers, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>and others, as well as
Government officials, learned professors, literary men, and
artists.</p>
<p>As a nation Norway cannot be considered wealthy, but the fact that
she employs so many ships for trading purposes is perhaps a proof that
she is fairly prosperous. There are few really rich Norwegians, and
still fewer who are able to live as independent gentlemen on their
estates; no man can claim the right to be called noble, for the
nobility of the country was abolished by law nearly a century ago, and
since then equality has been the birthright of every Norseman. But no
one can prevent money made in trade gradually finding its way into the
pockets of a few capable men of business, and thus class distinctions
must be created. The majority of the Norwegians, however, are content
to work and earn sufficient to maintain themselves and their families
in fairly comfortable circumstances, and fortunately the products of
the country enable them to do so.</p>
<p>The forests, covering as they do almost one-fourth of the area of
Norway, are of immense value, and the timber trade is a source of
income to a great number of the people. Much of it, of course, is used
in the country itself, as the houses and bridges are mostly built of
wood; but there is plenty left to be exported to England and other
foreign countries, as anyone who visits the ports in the South of
Norway can judge for himself. Between Christiansand and Christiania,
for instance, one may see enormous stores of timber awaiting shipment,
and one wonders how it will ever be shipped. Then, travelling among the
forest-clad mountains, one finds the woodman busy with his axe, and the
great bare tree-trunks being hauled down to the banks of the torrent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>or river, so as to float on the waters to the low
country, and thence even to the sea-coast. Again, on lakes like the
Randsfjord, the sight presented by the gathered logs, which have
floated down from the mountains, and which are being rafted for their
final voyage, is an extraordinary one. Acres and acres of floating
timber cover the end of the lake, and the massive trunks are packed so
close that you might wander about on them at your will for hours.</p>
<p>But it is not only timber in a raw state that does so much for the
prosperity of Norway, for a great trade is done also in matches as well
as in wood-pulp. The latter is a comparatively modern industry, and its
development has been rapid. Anyone who visits Christiania and has the
opportunity of taking the little town of H&ouml;nefos in his travels,
should not fail to pay a visit to the pulping works. It is said that in
Chicago one may see a herd of swine driven in at the front gate of a
factory and brought out at another gate in the form of sausages. At
H&ouml;nefos trees go into the works and come out as paper, or very
nearly so.</p>
<p>The waterfall, which gave a name to the place, is at the meeting of
two rivers&mdash;one flowing from Spirillen Lake and the other from the
Randsfjord, and was at one time beautiful. Now, however, its
picturesqueness is marred by the presence of a barn-like structure
containing the pulping works, while the fall itself is utilized to
drive the machinery. And, it must be confessed, all this has been
brought about by an Englishman, for here at H&ouml;nefos is made the
paper upon which is printed <i>Lloyd&rsquo;s Weekly</i> and the
<i>Daily Chronicle</i>. Neither is the fact concealed, but rather
boasted of in large letters on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12"
href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>the outside of the barn. But
Norway can well spare this one scrap from its storehouse of scenery,
and the works find regular employment for upwards of a hundred
Norwegians.</p>
<p>The process of pulping is simplicity itself; the trees are felled in
the forests on the hillsides close by, and sawn into blocks. Aerial
wires stretch from the felling ground to the works, and the blocks come
swinging down in baskets, to be handed over forthwith to the mercy of
the machinery. With the aid of heavy crushers and a certain amount of
water the logs are soon reduced to pulp, which then floats away into
sifters, to be eventually rolled out into flat sheets.</p>
<p>An immense amount of this pulp is exported to England in sacks, and
is used for many other purposes besides paper-making.</p>
<p>Another thing which we get from Norway is ice. Most of those huge
blocks of ice which you see in the fishmongers&rsquo; shops in the
summer have come across the North Sea, and ice-cutting is a very
important business in the winter months. The ice is obtained
principally from the mountain lakes, and in the vicinity of Christiania
long wooden chutes are erected from the mountain-tops to the edge of
the fjord. Down these the huge cubes travel, direct from their homes to
the deck of the boat, and thus save the cost of overland transport.
They are sawn most carefully, the dimensions being about two feet each
way; rope handles are then frozen into the blocks for facility of
movement, and the cubes are stored in ice-houses until the summer, by
which time they have lost almost half their original weight.</p>
<p>Next to timber, the chief export from the country is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>fish
(including cod-liver oil). The great fisheries are round the
Lof&ouml;dden Islands on the North-West Coast, well within the Arctic
Circle, and it is estimated that some 30,000 men and 6,000 boats are
engaged in capturing the cod from January to April each year. The
fishermen assemble from far and wide, and take up their residence for
the season in temporary huts, clustered together on the shores of the
islands. The work is arduous as well as dangerous, for storms and heavy
seas are of frequent occurrence, and tides and currents among the
islands most treacherous. And here, close to the fisheries, is situated
the dreaded whirlpool, the M&aelig;lstrom of renown.</p>
<p>But it is the people&rsquo;s living, and in a favourable season they
make immense hauls. An ordinary catch for an ordinary day is 500 cod
per boat, and a good day will double that number, though in such a case
the boat has to make a second trip to bring the fish ashore. A simple
calculation will show that millions of cod are landed on the islands
every day. Imagine the sight and imagine the smell!</p>
<p>The fish are split open and, after the roe and the liver have been
removed, hung up on hurdles to dry. Some are sold to the
fishing-smacks, which come to the islands to buy the fresh fish, and
then salt it down in barrels, or take it away to dry elsewhere. Scores
of bundles of dried cod, looking like slips of leather, may be seen for
the remainder of the year on every wharf in Norway. Who eats it all is
a mystery; but it goes to England and Spain in large quantities, and
most of us have eaten it on Ash Wednesdays.</p>
<p>Cod&rsquo;s roe and liver are probably of more value than
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>the fish from which they are extracted, and there
are large factories for making cod-liver oil, not only at the
Lof&ouml;ddens, but also at other places on the coast. At Hammerfest,
which boasts of being the northernmost town in the world, the whole air
is laden with the nauseous fumes issuing from the steaming caldrons of
boiling cod-liver oil.</p>
<p>The fish trade of Norway is not, however, confined to cod and the
Lof&ouml;dden Isles, for in many other parts fishing is the chief
industry of the people, and hundreds of thousands of barrels of salted
herrings and sprats leave the country every year, while sardines and
anchovies are tinned or potted in the factories at Stavanger and other
large seaports. The salmon, also, for which the Norwegian rivers are
famous, are brought over to England packed in ice, and well repay the
owners of the rivers.</p>
<p>Even in the depth of winter a good deal of sea fishing goes on
through the ice of the frozen fjords. The fisherman erects a shelter of
some kind to protect him from the biting wind, and within view of this
he breaks two or three holes in the thick ice. In each hole his baited
hooks are dropped down, the other end of the line being fastened to a
simple contrivance of pieces of stick, which begin to waggle when a
fish is hooked. On the Christiania Fjord numbers of these sporting
fishermen are to be seen at work all through the winter, and judging by
the frequency of their visits to their different holes, they must take
a quantity of fish. It is cold work, however, sitting and watching for
the signal to come from the hole, and one cannot help admiring the
men&rsquo;s energy and keenness.</p>
<p>It is only natural that, living in a country where fish <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>is so
plentiful, the people themselves should be great fish-eaters, and the
daily fish-markets at Bergen and other places on the coast are most
interesting sights. As a rule the fish are brought to market alive in
half-sunken canoes, towed astern of the fishing-boats, and at Bergen
all the bargaining is done between the buyers on the quayside and the
sellers in their boats.</p>
<p>In proportion to the population the variety of occupations in Norway
is certainly great, and there are other industries besides those
already mentioned. There is, for example, a considerable trade in skins
and furs, in condensed milk, butter, and margarine, and in certain
minerals and chemicals. Employment is found also for many men on the
railways&mdash;in road-making, in boat and shipbuilding, in
timber-dressing, in mechanical engineering, in slate-quarrying, in
stone-cutting, and in mining (principally in the silver mines at
K&ouml;ngsberg).</p>
<p>It would seem, therefore, as if there were plenty of work for the
Norwegians to do, and they are willing workers. Abject poverty, as we
know the term, has no place in Norway at present, for the country can
support its people, thanks, perhaps, to the fact that the desire to
emigrate to America and Canada is strong.</p>

<h2 class="label">Chapter IV</h2>
<h2 class="main">On the Farm</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Norway is not like England, where nearly every bit of
ground is cultivated, for nothing will grow on bare rocks, and a good
deal of Norway is barren land. In fact, except in the low country down
in the south, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16"
name="pb16">16</a>]</span>only land worth cultivating lies, as a rule,
in the valleys near the fjords. There are situated all the farms,
sometimes with small orchards of apples and cherries, but more often
with potato plots, a little corn, and a great amount of grassland. As
the mountains are always so close at hand, the fields are generally
strewn with rocks and boulders, and are very uneven, so haymaking is
not easy, and such a thing as a mowing-machine would be quite
useless.</p>
<p>Every blade of grass that can be gathered has to be made into hay,
otherwise the ponies and cows would starve in the winter, as they are
often snowed up for weeks at a time. Haymaking is, therefore, a great
business, and the amount of grass which the Norwegians contrive to
scrape off their land is marvellous. At the best of times it only grows
to a height of about six inches, but scythes and reaping-hooks find
their way into every nook and corner, and grass that no English farmer
would trouble to cut is all raked in with the greatest care. Parties go
up the mountain-sides to ledges of the cliffs, and on to the tops of
the mountains, to make sure that nothing is wasted, the grass being
brought down to the farms to be dried.</p>
<p>Long wires may be seen stretching from the valleys away up,
thousands of feet, to the tops of the mountains, and on these the
bundles of grass are tied, to come swirling down to the farmstead.
There is no time in the short Northern summer to make the hay as we
make it, and there is usually so much rain that the grass would never
dry at all if left lying on the ground; so long hurdles are put up in
positions where they will catch the sun and the wind, and on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>them the grass is hung up to dry, there remaining
until it has made itself into hay. Afterwards it is stored in covered
barns ready for winter use.</p>
<p>The corn, also, is dried in a peculiar manner. As it is cut it is
made up into small sheaves, a number of these being tied, ears
downwards, to a pole planted upright in the ground. This makes drying
rapid, and, if wet weather sets in, the rain runs off freely. A field
of these wheat-stacks has a very odd appearance at a little distance,
and near the woods one sees similar, though somewhat larger, stacks of
branches and leaves, on which the goats are fed in the winter.</p>
<p>Directly the snow has melted off the mountains the flocks and herds
are sent up to the highland pastures (s&aelig;ters), usually in charge
of the younger women and girls of the farm, and there, throughout the
summer, the dairy work is carried on. As in all mountainous countries,
rich and sweet herbage follows the melting of the snow, and the cows
and goats give an abundance of good milk, which is turned into butter
and cheese, to be sold or consumed in the winter. Life at the
s&aelig;ter-hut, or mountain farm, is healthy and delightful, though
much hard work has to be got through each day.</p>
<p>Children seldom go to the s&aelig;ters until old enough to be able
to do real work, but one often sees a girl of fourteen or so looking
after a flock of goats. She will be out with them all day as they feed
on the mountain-sides, and will do all the milking. When seen for the
first time this is rather an amusing operation, and decidedly a
practical one. The milkmaid seizes a goat, straddles her, with face
towards the goat&rsquo;s tail, and, stooping down, proceeds to milk.
From a little <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>distance all you see is the goat&rsquo;s hind-legs
emerging from beneath a blue petticoat, which looks most peculiar.</p>
<p>But the children who are too young to spend the summer at the
s&aelig;ters find plenty to do at home, and they learn almost as soon
as they can toddle that there is work for everyone. Quite small boys
and girls manage to do a good day&rsquo;s haymaking, and they can row a
boat or drive a <i>carriole</i> before they have reached their teens.
Such things they regard as amusements, for they have few other ways of
amusing themselves, and their one ambition is to do what their fathers
and mothers do.</p>
<p>In some cases the small farmers move their whole families up to the
mountain pastures for the summer; and, in addition to the dairy work,
they rent the fishing on some of the mountain lakes, which they net
freely. The trout thus caught are split open and salted down in
barrels, eventually being sent down to the markets in the towns, where
they fetch a good price. And all these peasants possess rifles, and are
keen sportsmen, so that when August comes they go in pursuit of the
wild reindeer, and lay up a store of meat, which, salted and dried,
comes in very handy in the hard times of winter.</p>
<p>As a rule the peasants eat very little meat, and what they do eat
has probably been smoked and dried and hung up for several months. A
good deal of salt fish is consumed; but the principal food is porridge
(<i lang="no">gr&ouml;d</i>), made of barley, rye, or oatmeal, and
eaten generally with sour buttermilk, with the addition of potatoes,
when plentiful. White bread is not found far from the towns, and the
black, or rye, bread is a heavy compound, a taste for which takes an
Englishman some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>time to acquire. But even that is superior to the
<i lang="no">fladbr&ouml;d</i>, which in appearance and consistency
resembles old boot-leather.</p>
<p>The well-to-do farmer lives more sumptuously. He occasionally has
fresh meat and fresh fish, and the dried articles nearly every day. He
also indulges in cheese, usually of the commoner kind, known as
<i lang="no">prim</i>, or <i lang="no">mysost</i>, which is not unlike
brown Windsor soap. There are two other native cheeses, but they are
considered somewhat expensive luxuries. They are called <i lang=
"no">gammelost</i> and <i lang="no">pultost</i>, and are made from sour
skimmed milk, being afterwards kept in a dark cellar for a year or so
to ripen. The latter is the greater delicacy, and is stored, in a
sloppy state, in wooden tubs. If you should ever chance to see one of
the tubs being produced, do not wait to see it opened, or your nose
will never forget it!</p>
<p>Verily, winter is the bugbear of the struggling Norwegian
countryman&rsquo;s existence. Like the provident ant, he spends the
greater part of the summer in laying up for the winter, and he has not
only himself and his family to think of, but also his cattle, for if
the latter cannot be properly housed and fed he will be ruined. There
are times, however, when he contrives to throw off the constant thought
of the future, and when he can enjoy himself thoroughly. Sunday is a
day of rest, with possibly a long row across the fjord to church, after
which comes a good gossip with the neighbours, and the chance of a
feast at a friend&rsquo;s farm. There are also high-days and holidays,
weddings and christenings, accompanied by plentiful food and drink, as
well as by dancing and fiddling. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20"
href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span></p>
<p>But when the snow covers up the country the days are none too
exciting, though the cattle have to be fed and many odd jobs attended
to. Most of the men are handy carpenters, and can make such things as
dairy utensils, while the women in many parts weave sufficient cloth to
keep the whole family clothed. By the younger men, however, the season
is looked forward to as a time of real enjoyment. Then it is that they
get out their snowshoes and enter with zest into the grand sport of
ski-ing, or, taking their guns with them, go off on their ski to shoot
ryper or hares for the market.</p>
<p>Such is the life of the ordinary small farmer and peasant; but down
by the fjords and on the beaten track of the foreign tourists the
larger farmer has grasped the situation, and has discovered the value
of having more than one string to his bow. So in summer he combines
hotel-keeping with farming. His farm produce is consumed in his hotel,
and if he is fortunate enough to have a salmon river flowing through
his land, he can be certain of a good rent for it. Thus the prosperous
farmer becomes a person of some importance in the district, and one
day, perhaps, a Member of the Storthing, or Parliament.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">Chapter V</h2>
<h2 class="main">Manners and Customs</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The religion of the country is the Lutheran, almost in
its original form, for in some matters the Norwegians are most
conservative. Though not, perhaps, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21"
href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>what we would consider a
religious-minded people, they are naturally good, honest, and kind, and
they take their religion on trust. They pay tithes, and give Easter and
Christmas offerings to their clergy willingly, since they regard the
priest as a superior person, and hold him in high esteem. He is a man,
like his fellows, and farms his own land, which appeals to the people
in the country parts. Moreover, he is possessed of learning, and away
from the towns he is mainly responsible for the national education.</p>
<p>Often the journey to church is long, for the farms lie far apart,
and when the church is distant ponies or boats are brought into
requisition for the conveyance of, at any rate, the women and children.
Down by the fjord on a fine Sunday morning the sight of the boats
crossing over to a church is a picturesque one. Deep laden with men,
women, and children, they come one after another; and when they reach
the shore, the women take their clean white head-dresses and gay
kerchiefs out of the compact little <i lang="no">tiner</i> (oval
chip-wood boxes), and finish their toilets before going up to the
church.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Sabbath begins on Saturday evening and ends at noon on
Sunday, after which time the day is spent in simple enjoyment as a true
holiday. Then in the evening the boats start for home, and across the
still waters one may hear the women singing glees, as often as not to
the accompaniment of the fiddle.</p>
<p>A wedding causes quite as much interest and excitement in Norway as
it does in England, and in the olden time the festivities lasted for a
week or more. Nowadays the merry-making has been somewhat curtailed,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>but the actual ceremony has lost none of its
solemnity and little of its brightness. In the towns civilization has
robbed the wedding of its picturesqueness. The men are clothed in their
best &ldquo;blacks,&rdquo; as if going to a funeral, and the ladies
wear dresses of Parisian style. But away in the depths of the country
one may still see a real Norwegian wedding, with the bride and
bridesmaids, if not also most of the guests, dressed in the national
costume, and it is a pretty sight.</p>
<p>In front comes a <i lang="no">stolkj&aelig;rre</i>, the pony being
led by the master of the ceremonies. On the seat sits the bride in the
full dress of the country, and wearing her bridal crown; by her side
the bridegroom, also well adorned for the occasion; and, on the step of
the cart, that most important person, the fiddler, working his bow with
astounding energy. If the pony can bear the weight, perhaps a couple of
the bride&rsquo;s relations will sit up behind, otherwise they will
walk in the procession which follows; and there may be seen all the
available peasants of the district&mdash;young men and maidens,
grandfathers and grandchildren.</p>
<p>So they wend their way to the church; and after the service, if the
good old customs be kept up, the party proceeds to a green close by and
enjoys a boisterous dance until it is time to go on to the wedding
supper. Feasting and merry-making then continue for several
hours&mdash;in fact, the sleepiness of the guests is the only thing
that breaks up the entertainment for the night. Next day the
festivities are resumed, and are possibly carried on into a third day.
The fiddler is always busy, for without him there can be no real fun,
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>people&rsquo;s love of music being no less than
their love of dancing.</p>
<p>The violin is the one instrument which they know and understand, and
it has been in use among the Norwegians for hundreds of years. Their
most famous violin-player, Ole Bull, who died some few years ago, was
looked on as a great composer and musician. But all over the country
there are to be found men who can play after a fashion; and a century
or so ago, when the people were still very superstitious, they fully
believed that anyone who could play at all well had had intercourse
with the fairies, who were supposed to be marvellous musicians and
acquainted with an immense variety of beautiful tunes.</p>
<p>The food provided at a peasant&rsquo;s wedding feast is, of course,
something out of the common, and the guests are supposed to bring a
present of something good to eat, such as fresh meat, butter, old
cream, cream porridge, or cheese, for the ordinary fare of the country
folk is, as we have said, of the plainest.</p>
<p>With regard to the national costume, mentioned above, it is,
unfortunately, a fact that it is gradually disappearing. There are
parts, however, where there are no railways, no steamboats, and few
tourists, and in such places the people still live much as they did a
hundred years ago, even the men wearing clothes similar to those worn
by their grandfathers and great-grandfathers, and some of these are
quaint in the extreme.</p>
<p>Perhaps the quaintest dresses are those of the people of
S&aelig;tersdal, a district in the South of Norway, between
Christiansand and Telemarken; and, when properly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>turned
out, the men are quite as &ldquo;dressy&rdquo; as the women. They wear
a pair of trousers buttoned with half a dozen silver buttons tight
round the ankles, and coming right up to the armpits. Several broad
stripes adorn the legs from top to bottom. And the coat takes the form
of a curious little cape, richly embroidered with silver, and having
sleeves, fastened at the wrists with more silver buttons. Shoes, with
buckles, white stockings, and a cut-down tall hat, gaily decorated with
ribbons and embroidery, complete the costume. The women wear short
skirts&mdash;only a little below the knees&mdash;of dark blue, with a
bright trimming round the bottom; coloured stockings; a bodice laced
with silver, and covered with silver brooches and other ornaments; a
waistbelt, which is sometimes entirely of metal; a kerchief tied over
the head, after the fashion of the bandana of West Indian negresses;
and on occasions a shawl of many colours.</p>
<p>A step farther north, in what is called Lower Telemarken, a similar
kind of dress still exists, though the man&rsquo;s waistcoat-jacket is
of a somewhat different pattern and colour, and the women wear their
skirts a trifle longer. On Sundays and great occasions the latter also
put on cloth stockings and gloves, embroidered tastefully with trails
of flowers.</p>
<p>But such dresses as these are not the national costume of Norway.
For that we have to go still farther north&mdash;to the Hardanger. If
an English girl wishes to dress a doll as a typical Norwegian, the
clothes would be those of the Hardanger, and they would be these: a
dark blue serge skirt (to the ankles), trimmed with black velvet and
silver braid; a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>white chemisette with full sleeves; a red flannel
bodice embroidered with white, black, and silver, and glittering with
brass saucer-shaped ornaments; and a waistbelt adorned with metal
buttons. The effect is neat, bright, and decidedly piquant. The girls
plait their fair hair in two long tails, wearing a handkerchief as a
head-dress; but the married women have a most elaborate coiffure,
something of the sister-of-mercy type, consisting of the so-called
<i lang="no">skaut</i>, or hood, and the <i lang="no">lin</i>, or
forehead band. It takes a considerable time to put on, as the
snow-white linen has to be most carefully stretched over a frame, which
is first fastened on the top of the head, and then so arranged that the
numerous small plaits hang in a particular manner. This is the ordinary
head-dress, though the country women coming in to church on Sundays
often wear curious old-fashioned bonnets, which have the appearance of
being heirlooms handed down from generation to generation.</p>
<p>The men do not dress up to the women. They confine themselves to a
rough trouser suit, generally of dark blue, and a black felt hat. Even
amongst the older men of the Hardanger one seldom sees the
knee-breeches and stockings which used to be worn.</p>

<h2 class="main">School and Play</h2>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I am not certain whether Norse boys and girls are very
good, or whether they are spoilt. You may travel all day on a steamer
with a well-to-do family from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26"
href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>town, or you may live in a
farmhouse with a peasant&rsquo;s family for a month, and the chances
are that you will never hear the parents say &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
One thing I am sure of: the children who live in the country parts do
very much as they please; in the summer they go to bed when they feel
tired, sometimes not till nearly midnight; and they are not worried
about getting their boots and their clothes wet, because no Norwegian
troubles his or her head about such matters. Moreover, the life is such
a simple one that perhaps there is little opportunity for real
naughtiness.</p>
<p>These country children have a very easy time, as for the greater
part of the year they have no school to go to, and they spend all the
summer out in the open air, looking after the ponies, cows, sheep, or
goats, or hay-making, or rowing about, or fishing, or something of the
kind. In the winter they, as well as the town children, are all obliged
to go to school, from the age of seven to fourteen or
fifteen&mdash;<i>i.e.,</i> until their Confirmation, and until this
takes place they receive religious instruction from the priest on
Sunday afternoons, for there is no religious teaching in the
schools.</p>
<p>There is a great difficulty about the country schools, because in
some districts the farms are miles and miles apart, and it would be
quite impossible for the children to walk to school and back in the
day. In such districts the Government schoolmasters have to go about
from place to place, and teach the children in their own homes. If
there should be two or three farms close together, one of the farmers
provides a schoolroom in his house, and the schoolmaster lives with him
as his guest for a time, and then goes on to another house.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>But the schoolmasters must give every child twelve
weeks&rsquo; schooling in the year. This does not amount to a great
deal&mdash;only three months of school in the year!</p>
<p>The wonder is that the children contrive to remember anything that
they have learned, with nine long months in which to forget it. Yet
they work hard while they are about it; they are inspected every year,
and they are required to pass quite difficult examinations at the end.
It is expected, however, that before long the twelve weeks&rsquo;
compulsory schooling will be increased to fifteen weeks.</p>
<p>In the towns the children are not forced to attend school for more
than the twelve weeks in the year, but there are, of course, numbers of
private schools, high schools, etc., to which parents can send their
children, on payment, for a superior education. And at such schools the
work goes on for a much longer period of the year&mdash;in fact, all
through the year, except for two months in the summer and a week at
Christmas and at Easter.</p>
<p>It is all much the same as our own arrangements in England. There is
the Government school, where the education is free, and there are other
schools, where a higher education is paid for. But the compulsory
schooling does not end with the seven years at the Government schools
referred to above, for there are continuation schools, at which the
pupils have to put in a further twenty-four weeks.</p>
<p>In Norway there are no large public schools for boarders, so, in
spite of their long holidays, the children do not have half the fun
that English boys and girls <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href=
"#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>have. There is no cricket, football,
hockey, golf, or any game of that sort, and there is not a racquet-,
fives-, or tennis-court in the land. How then, you will ask, do they
manage to amuse themselves?</p>
<p>It must be remembered that the winter is much longer in Norway than
it is with us, and even if the boys wanted to play football they would
not be able to do so, as the ground is covered with snow. At that
season they have their various winter sports to keep them
busy&mdash;ski-ing, skating, tobogganing, and the like, and they do not
require any other games. In the summer, instead of playing cricket,
they go for walking tours into the mountains, or they go fishing in the
rivers and lakes, or sometimes shooting.</p>
<p>Though the Norwegians boast that ball games have been played in the
country since Saga times, such games are of the most elementary kind,
and would be scorned by any English boy. But for all that the Norse
boys are every bit as manly as any other boys, because they enjoy many
forms of sport which make them so; and they are strong, because they
take plenty of exercise, and have physical drill in their schools.</p>
<p>This brings us to other games played by Norwegian children&mdash;not
the games which are purchased in the shops in Christiania, Bergen, and
other towns, but the games which are played without any of the bought
things. Of course the girls have dolls and dolls&rsquo; houses and
dolls&rsquo; tea-parties, like the girls of every land, and there are
toys of every description in the shops. The peasant children, however,
who live far out in the country, never see a shop, and have to provide
themselves with things to play with; but it is wonderful <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>what an
amount of amusement they can get out of an old bone, or a block of
wood, tied to a yard or two of string.</p>
<p>As a rule their fathers are good hands at carving wood, so toys are
easily made for the smaller children, and one finds everywhere such
simple toys as wooden dolls, animals, miniature boats, sleighs, and
carts.</p>
<p>But the real enjoyment of the Norwegian children&mdash;at any rate
of the girls&mdash;is the outdoor game, played when the weather is
fine, both in the town and in the country, wherever there are enough
children to make a game. To see a bevy of these quaint little girls
throwing heart and soul into their games is delightful, and they have
scores and scores of different ones. In most of them dancing and
singing play a great part, and the most popular form of game is what is
called a &ldquo;Ring Dance,&rdquo; in which, as the name implies, the
players join hands and dance round in a circle.</p>
<p>Many of these ring dances have their counterpart in English games,
and the tunes and words sung to them are almost similar. Whether we
adopted them from the Norwegians, or they adopted them from us, is a
matter which will probably never be decided, but several games of this
kind are common to all Europe. &ldquo;Blind Man&rsquo;s Buff,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hunt the Slipper,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Forfeits,&rdquo; for
instance, are found nearly everywhere. Here is the Norse version of
&ldquo;Round and round the Mulberry Bush,&rdquo; which in some parts is
called &ldquo;The Washing-Maids&rsquo; Dance,&rdquo; and in others
&ldquo;Round the Juniper Bush&rdquo;: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;So we go round the juniper bush, the juniper
bush, the juniper bush,</p>
<p class="line">So we go round the juniper bush early on Monday
morning.</p>
<p class="line">This is the way we wash our clothes, wash our clothes,
wash our clothes,</p>
<p class="line">This is the way we wash our clothes early on Monday
morning.</p>
</div>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;So we go round the juniper bush, the juniper
bush, the juniper bush,</p>
<p class="line">So we go round the juniper bush early on Tuesday
morning.</p>
<p class="line">This is the way we ring out our clothes, ring out our
clothes, ring out our clothes,</p>
<p class="line">This is the way we ring out our clothes early on
Tuesday morning.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The washing operations proceed through the next three
days of the week, with a verse to each day. Thus on Wednesday they hang
up the clothes, on Thursday they mangle them, and on Friday iron them.
Then on Saturday they scrub the floor, and on Sunday go to church.</p>
<p>With each verse the children dance hand in hand round the imaginary
juniper bush, singing lustily, and illustrating the different actions
of the washing operations. Finally, two and two and arm in arm, they
promenade round, as if going to church, and generally prolong the walk
while they sing the last verse a second time.</p>
<p>Another very favourite game is <i lang="no">Sl&aelig;ngkompas</i>,
which is perhaps best translated almost literally as Scatter-Compass.
It is a rapid game, and full of excitement. The players grasp hands in
a circle and gallop round, singing the refrain as they go:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Those who would join in <i lang=
"no">Sl&aelig;ngkompas</i> must be tolerably quick!</p>
<p class="line">One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;and four&mdash;and
five.</p>
<p class="line">So comes <i lang="no">Sl&aelig;ngkompas</i>
again.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the counting begins the players let go hands, and, clapping to
the tune, spin round separately until the word &ldquo;five&rdquo; is
reached, when they should be in position ready to join hands again and
continue to gallop round in the original circle.</p>
<p>The aim of the game is to keep things going until the verse has been
sung three times, but, of course, the players often become giddy and
lose their places.</p>
<p>There is not space to describe more of these ring dances here, but
there are many of them, and a great many which our English children
would do well to adopt.</p>
<p>Our good old street game of &ldquo;Hop-scotch&rdquo; you may see
played almost anywhere in Norway under the somewhat curious name of
&ldquo;Hop-in-Paradise,&rdquo; while in some parts &ldquo;Cat&rsquo;s
Cradle,&rdquo; though a milder form of amusement, is quite popular, and
a large variety of figures is known.</p>
<p>Then the girls are very fond of dressing up as brides, with crowns
and all, and having a mock wedding, with its accompanying procession
and dancing. Above all things they love dancing, and their fathers and
grandfathers play the fiddle for them for many an hour of a
winter&rsquo;s evening, while the mothers sing nursery rhymes to the
smaller children. And, as with the games, these jingles are more or
less the same as our own. They have &ldquo;This is the house that Jack
built,&rdquo; with the malt, and the rat, and everything, only that
they prefer the name Jacob to Jack. They have &ldquo;Fly away, Peter,
fly away, Paul&rdquo;; and the baby on his mother&rsquo;s knee has the
joy of being shaken about to &ldquo;This is the way the farmer rides,
bumpety-bumpety-bump.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="label">Chapter VII</h2>
<h2 class="main">Some Fairy Tales</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Norwegian children are just as fond of fairy stories
as are any other children, and they are lucky in having a great number,
for that famous story-teller, Hans Christian Andersen, was a Dane, and
as the Danish language is very like the Norwegian, his stories were
probably known in Norway long before they were known in England. But
the Norwegians have plenty of other stories of their own, and they love
to sit by the fire of burning logs or round the stove in the long
winter evenings and listen to them. Of course, they know all about
people like Cinderella and Jack the Giant-Killer, but their favourite
hero is called by the name of Ashpot, who is sometimes a kind of boy
Cinderella and sometimes a Jack the Giant-Killer.</p>
<p>The following are two stories which the little yellow-haired Norse
children gloat over:</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a man who had been out cutting wood, and
when he came home he found that he had left his coat behind, so he told
his little daughter to go and fetch it. The child started off, but
before she reached the wood darkness came on, and suddenly a great big
hill-giant swooped down upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Mr. Giant,&rdquo; said she, trembling all over,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t take me away to-night, as father wants his coat; but
to-morrow night, if you will come when I go to the <i lang=
"no">stabbur</i> to fetch the bread, I will go away with you quite
quietly.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span></p>
<p>So the giant agreed, and the next night, when she went to fetch the
bread, he came and carried her off. As soon as it was found that she
was missing, her father sent her eldest brother to look for her, but he
came back without finding her. The second brother was also sent, but
with no better result. At last the father turned to his youngest son,
who was the drudge of the house, and said: &ldquo;Now, Ashpot, you go
and see if you can find your sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So away went Ashpot, and no sooner had he reached the wood than he
met a bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend bear,&rdquo; said Ashpot, &ldquo;will you help
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; answered the bear. &ldquo;Get up on my
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Ashpot mounted the bear&rsquo;s back and rode off. Presently
they met a wolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend wolf,&rdquo; said Ashpot, &ldquo;will you do some work
for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; answered the wolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then jump up behind,&rdquo; said Ashpot, and the three went
on deeper into the wood.</p>
<p>They next met a fox, and then a hare, both of whom were enlisted
into Ashpot&rsquo;s service, and, mounted on the back of the bear, were
swiftly carried off to the giant&rsquo;s abode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day, Mr. Giant!&rdquo; said they.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scratch my back!&rdquo; roared the giant, who lay stretched
in front of the fire warming himself.</p>
<p>The hare immediately climbed up and began to scratch as desired; but
the giant knocked him over, and down he fell on to the hearth-stone,
breaking off his fore-legs, since which time all hares have had short
fore-legs. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>The fox next clambered up to scratch the giant&rsquo;s back, but he
was served like the hare. Then the wolf&rsquo;s turn came, but the
giant said that he was no better at scratching than the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> scratch me!&rdquo; shouted the giant, turning
impatiently to the bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered Bruin; &ldquo;I know all about
scratching,&rdquo; and he forthwith dug his claws into the
giant&rsquo;s back and ripped it into a thousand pieces.</p>
<p>Then all the beasts danced on the dead body of the monster, and
Ashpot recovered his sister and took her home, carrying off, at the
same time, all the giant&rsquo;s gold and silver. The bear and the wolf
burst into the cattle-sheds and devoured all the cows and sheep, the
fox feasted in the henroost, while the hare had the free run of the
oatfield. So everyone was satisfied.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The other story is also about Ashpot, whose two elder brothers still
treated him very badly, and eventually turned him out of his home. Poor
Ashpot wandered away up into the mountains, where he met a huge giant.
At first he was terribly afraid, but after a little while he told the
giant what had happened to him, and asked him if he could find a job
for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are just the very man I want,&rdquo; said the giant.
&ldquo;Come along with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first work to be done was to make a fire to brew some ale, so
they went off together to the forest to cut firewood. The giant carried
a club in place of an axe, and when they came to a large birch-tree he
asked Ashpot whether he would like to club the tree down or climb up
and hold the top of it. The boy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35"
href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>thought that the latter would
suit him best, and he soon got up to the topmost branches and held on
to them. But the giant gave the tree such a blow with his club as to
knock it right out of the ground, sending Ashpot flying across the
meadows into a marsh. Luckily he landed on soft ground, and was none
the worse for his adventure; and they soon managed to get the tree
home, when they set to work to make a fire.</p>
<p>But the wood was green, and would not burn, so the giant began to
blow. At the first puff Ashpot found himself flying up to the ceiling
as if he had been a feather, but he managed to catch hold of a piece of
birch-bark among the rafters, and on reaching the ground again he told
the giant that he had been up to get something to make the fire
burn.</p>
<p>The fire was soon burning splendidly, and the giant commenced to
brew the ale, drinking it off as fast as it was made. Ashpot watched
him getting gradually drunk, and heard him mutter to himself,
&ldquo;To-night I will kill him,&rdquo; so he began to think of a plan
to outwit his master. When he went to bed he placed the giant&rsquo;s
cream-whisk between the sheets as a dummy, while he himself crept under
the bedstead.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, just as he had expected, he heard the
giant come into his room, and then there was a tremendous whack as the
giant brought his club down on to the bed. Next morning the boy came
out of his room as if nothing had happened, and his master was very
much surprised to find him still alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said the giant. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you feel
anything in the night?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href=
"#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I did feel something,&rdquo; said Ashpot; &ldquo;but I
thought that it was only a sausage-peg that had fallen on the bed, so I
went to sleep again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The giant was more astonished than ever, and went off to consult his
sister, who lived in a neighbouring mountain, and was about ten times
his size. At length it was settled that the giantess should set her
cooking-pot on the fire, and that Ashpot should be sent to see her,
when she was to tip him into the caldron and boil him. In the course of
the day the giant sent the boy off with a message to his sister, and
when he reached the giantess&rsquo;s dwelling he found her busy
cooking. But he soon saw through her design, and he took out of his
pocket a nut with a hole in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, showing the nut to the ogress,
&ldquo;you think you can do everything. I will tell you one thing that
you can&rsquo;t do: you can&rsquo;t make yourself so small as to be
able to creep into the hole in this nut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; replied the giantess. &ldquo;Of course I
can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in a moment she became as small as a fly, and crept into the
nut, whereupon Ashpot hurled it into the fire, and that was the end of
the giantess.</p>
<p>The boy was so delighted that he returned to his old tyrant the
giant and told him what had happened to his sister. This set the big
man thinking again as to how he was to rid himself of this sharp-witted
little nuisance. He did not understand boys, and he was afraid of
Ashpot&rsquo;s tricks, so he offered him as much gold and silver as he
could carry if he would go away and never return. Ashpot, however,
replied that the amount he could carry would not be worth having,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>and that he could not think of going unless he got
as much as the giant could carry.</p>
<p>The giant, glad to get rid of him at any cost, agreed, and, loading
himself with gold and silver and precious stones, he set out with the
boy towards his home. When they reached the outskirts of the farms they
saw a herd of cattle, and the giant began to tremble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of beasts are these?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are my father&rsquo;s cows,&rdquo; replied Ashpot,
&ldquo;and you had better put down your burden and run back to your
mountain, or they may bite you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The giant was only too happy to get away, so, depositing his load,
which was as big as a small hill, he made off, and left the boy to
carry his treasure home by himself.</p>
<p>So enormous was the amount of the valuables that it was six years
before Ashpot succeeded in removing everything from the field where the
giant had set it down; but he and all his relations were rich people
for the rest of their lives.</p>

<h2 class="label">Chapter VIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Hardanger Fjord</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All that is grand, all that is beautiful, will be
found in the Hardanger&mdash;the &ldquo;Smiling Hardanger,&rdquo; as
the Norwegians themselves call it; and even if an English visitor went
nowhere else, he would have seen typical Norwegian scenery of every
possible kind.</p>
<p>The easiest way to go there is from Bergen, and most people bent on
a tour in Norway make a start either <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>from Christiania or from
Bergen. Bergen itself claims to be the most beautiful town in the
country, and it really is a lovely spot, with its old wooden houses all
around the harbour, full of picturesque shipping, and with its
amphitheatre of bold mountains rising upwards almost from the centre of
the town. But Bergen has its drawbacks, and the principal one is that
it rains every day, or nearly every day.</p>
<p>To reach the Hardanger from Bergen, and to go from one end of the
fjord to the other, you take a passage in one of the comfortable little
local steamers, and you begin your journey early in the morning. It is
a very pleasant way of travelling, as you sit on deck all day and enjoy
the scenery, and only go down to the saloon at meal-times. If you do
not wish to go all the way to the very end of the fjord, there are
numbers of pretty little places where you can break your journey. But
if you like you can travel throughout the day and finish up late at
night at Odda, or at Vik-i-Eidfjord, each of which is at the head of a
branch of the Hardanger Fjord.</p>
<p>Let us take our tickets right through to Eidfjord, make a good long
day of it, and see what there is to be seen. For some little time after
leaving the harbour we see nothing of great interest, only a few
graceful-looking barges in full sail, reminding us of the pictures of
the old Viking ships, and flocks of seagulls fluttering and screaming
round the stern of our boat. Then the steamer begins to pick its way
through the scattered islands, some of which are mere barren granite
rocks, others partially cultivated, and with neat little farmsteads
lying snug in the valleys. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href=
"#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span></p>
<p>So we go on for an hour or two, occasionally stopping off a small
group of farms, to land, perhaps, a farmer returning from the Bergen
market, or a girl coming home from her situation in the town. Presently
we come alongside a pier under an overhanging cliff, and we see the
name of the place written up on a board, just like the name of a
railway-station. This is God&ouml;sund, a favourite holiday haunt of
the Bergen people. It is not a town or even a village, but just a
ch&acirc;let-like hotel of two or three buildings, standing on the side
of a fir-clad hill, in the midst of a fairyland of creeks and wooded
islets&mdash;as pretty a spot as one could wish to see.</p>
<p>Now we are nearing the Hardanger Fjord; we pass through the narrow
straits known as the L&ouml;ksund, and we enter the fjord. Glorious and
ever-changing views open out before us, as hour after hour the steamer
passes from one small station to another, dropping a mail-bag, and
perhaps a passenger or two. We pass farms lying close to the shore, the
wooden houses being in many cases painted red or white, and thus
forming a brilliant contrast to the blue-black mountains and dark green
forests which rise up behind them. We see every now and then a clean
white wooden church, and, away up on the mountain-sides we can discern
tiny specks, which, we are told, are the s&aelig;ter dwellings.</p>
<p>Sometimes the steamer is out in the middle of the fjord, which, in
parts, is five miles or more in width, but at other times we find
ourselves close in to a rocky precipice, and wondering how it will be
possible to avoid grounding. Above us the mountain-side rises
perpendicularly to a height of, it may be, 3,000 or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>4,000
feet; and, looking down into the clear water, we can see that it is
ever so deep. As a matter of fact, the chart tells us that hereabouts
it is a little more than 2,000 feet in depth.</p>
<p>Soon we reach the bay in which is Rosendal, where one could spend a
very pleasant week or so, with trout fishing to be had in the streams
and lakes, and mountain walks up to the edge of the great Folgefond
snowfield. The steamer calls for a few minutes, and then goes on up the
beautiful little branch fjord known as the Mauranger, at the extremity
of which lies Sundal.</p>
<p>The scenery here is delightful, and especially so at the spot where
the Bondhus Valley is seen stretching down to the fjord. Half-way up
the valley a round-topped mountain appears to bar the way, and farther
off a blue-grey glacier&mdash;the Bondhus Br&aelig;&mdash;is seen
falling from the white snowfield, and choking the head of the vale.</p>
<p>Those who have the mind to do so can wander up to the glacier, sleep
the night at a s&aelig;ter, and on the following day hire a sleigh, and
career for miles over the vast field of perpetual snow, right across
the headland to Odda. And great is the joy of plunging suddenly, on a
hot August day, into the depths of winter.</p>
<p>But our steamer does not stay here long&mdash;only long enough to
put some Norwegian passengers on shore, and take fresh ones on board.
This occupies some time, however, for Norse people, and especially the
ladies, refuse to be hurried. It is amusing to watch them starting on
their travels. All their friends come to see them off, although it is
quite possible that the traveller is only going to the next station on
the fjord, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>not a dozen miles away. Each friend bears some
small package&mdash;a pot of cranberry jam, a basket of apples or
cherries, a bag of cakes, or something of that kind. The gaily-painted
wooden trunks and the <i lang="no">tiners</i> are stowed away on board;
and then the &ldquo;farvels&rdquo; commence, with kisses and
handshakes, and pats on the back, and many last words until the bell
rings for the steamer&rsquo;s departure, when a lady passenger suddenly
discovers that she has left something behind. The wildest confusion
follows, and away run all the friends to fetch it from the house,
returning just in time. Then the good-byes begin again, and as the
steamer finally departs, everyone shouts, &ldquo;Farvel! farvel!
farvel!&rdquo; frequently and rapidly; hats are raised, and
handkerchiefs continue waving until the boat can no longer be seen.</p>
<div class="figure p41width" id="p41"><img src="images/p41.jpg" alt=

<p class="first"><i>Page <a href="#pb39" class=
"pageref">39</a>.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Returning down the Mauranger Fjord we steam out across the main
fjord, and early in the afternoon call at several small places on the
northern shore&mdash;Bakke, Vikingn&aelig;s, Nordheimsund&mdash;each
with its spruce hotel, enticing the traveller to loiter and explore the
country in the neighbourhood. A little later we enter the Fiksensund, a
narrow branch fjord, and a wonder of wonders. For a distance of seven
miles it wends its way amongst the mountains. In places the precipitous
hillsides are within a hundred yards of each other, and in no part is
this extraordinary fjord-arm a third of a mile in width. For thousands
of feet sheer out of the water rise the bold walls of granite, with
here and there a ledge thickly wooded with fir and birch. It looks as
if the mountains had been torn asunder to admit the sea, and local
legends say that a spiteful giantess did this and many other nasty
things in the giant age. Half-way <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42"
href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>up the fjord the steamer fires a
gun, so that the passengers may hear the echo, and the sound comes back
time after time from every nook and cranny. At the end is Botnen, with
a road running away north to other farms, and eventually to the railway
from Bergen to Vossevangen.</p>
<p>Again we return to the main fjord, and before long enter the
Gravensfjord, wherein lies Eide, a kind of junction of the
steamer-routes, and a very touristy place, as there is a good
driving-road to Voss. The Bergen steamer continues its way up the
S&ouml;rfjord to Odda, which is reached late at night; but we, who are
bound for Eidfjord, change into a small branch steamer, and are soon
rounding a mighty headland, and, if there is any wind, getting a
tossing for a few minutes, the fjord just here being wide and open. The
head of a seal may occasionally be seen bobbing up and down, and large
flocks of duck are always swimming about at a respectful distance from
the steamer. And what a view we have across the expanse of water! The
never-ending mountains stretch away one behind the other, to be crowned
in the distance by the dazzling white snowfield, lighted up by the fast
sinking sun.</p>
<p>And when the sun goes down the scenery, as we steam on, changes each
moment. In the twilight the granite cliffs stand out black and
uninviting, and the country looks cold and grey. It may be that we are
tired of the long journey, for with the growing darkness comes the
feeling that something to eat and bed would be pleasant things. Then
the steamer&rsquo;s whistle makes us spring to our feet, and, peering
ahead, we see lights on the Vik jetty and in the hotel close by. In a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>few minutes we are in N&aelig;sheim&rsquo;s
comfortable dining-room, enjoying our well-deserved supper after a day
of days on Norway&rsquo;s most glorious fjord.</p>

<h2 class="label">Chapter IX</h2>
<h2 class="main">A Glimpse of the Fjelds</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Fjeld-weather&rdquo; is the Norwegian term for
fine, warm, bright days. It implies that the weather is suitable for a
tour on the mountains. But, alas! it is not the weather that is always
encountered there, for even in the summer the climate of the high
plateau is ever varying, and though there may be a long spell of fine,
hot weather, with a glorious crisp air, yet at any moment a change of
the wind may bring a week of soaking rain, sleet, possibly snow, and a
fall of temperature by twenty degrees. That is no time for the fjelds,
and the traveller is better off in a fjordside hotel.</p>
<p>Given fine weather, there is no more splendid touring ground than
the highlands of Norway, where, at a height of anything up to 4,000 or
5,000 feet above the sea, stretch thousands of square miles of wild and
uninhabited moorland, cut up with numerous large lakes, and clothed
only with a dwarf vegetation. Such parts usually lie off the beaten
track, and to reach them means an expedition&mdash;heavy, uphill
walking for two or three days, with the baggage carried on the backs of
ponies.</p>
<p>If you were going to undertake an expedition to these high fjelds,
you would probably make a start <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44"
href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>from the lowlands by following
some well-worn track leading to a s&aelig;ter. In nine cases out of ten
the track will be running by the side of a river, at first wide and
flowing lazily through the valley, but soon narrowing, until its upper
waters become a rushing mountain torrent, swishing between mighty
boulders. After a while you find that the path gradually begins to
ascend by zigzags up the mountain-side, and the scenery, whenever you
pause to look down, is magnificent. In time you reach the upland
pastures, with here and there a s&aelig;ter-dwelling, and this is the
end of the first stage of your journey, for you probably will have
climbed some 2,000 feet and walked a dozen miles or more. Thus you will
be glad enough to accept the hospitality offered to you by the simple
peasants.</p>
<p>All these s&aelig;ter-huts are much alike, though, of course, they
vary in size and in the way in which they are fitted up; but as they
are only occupied during the summer months, luxurious fittings are not
considered a necessity. The outer walls are constructed of fir-trunks,
let into one another at the corners on the log-hut principle, and the
interior is lined with boarding. In some parts, however, where timber
is scarce the buildings are of stone.</p>
<p>The roof consists of rough planks, on which is placed a layer of
birch-bark to fill in the cracks; and on the top, again, are laid sods
of earth to a thickness of about a foot. Grass and weeds soon cover the
roof, binding it together and keeping the rain out.</p>
<p>The door opens into a dark hall or chamber, which serves as a
receptacle for rubbish of all kinds&mdash;fishing-nets, tools, skins,
empty milk-pans, and the like; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45"
href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>in the corner is a roughly-built
fireplace for boiling the milk and for cooking. On one side of this
hall is the door into the sole living apartment, which possesses a
window at one end, and against one of the side walls a couple of bunks,
wherein three or four dairymaids sleep.</p>
<p>Sometimes there is a separate room, or even a detached hut, for the
dairy work; but there is generally only the one room, the milk being
set in large, shallow wooden vessels on a number of shelves fixed
against one of the walls. Everything is scrupulously clean, and the
cattle women are working hard all the long daylight hours. Periodically
a man from the farm in the lowlands comes up to the s&aelig;ter with a
couple of ponies and takes down butter and cheese, and such visits are
the only excitement in s&aelig;ter-life.</p>
<p>If you have time to linger here for a day or two you will be made
welcome, and you will find plenty to interest you. The views down into
the deep valleys and away to the fjords in the distance are always
delightful, and there may be a stream with pools holding trout worth
trying for. The tiny rivulets which trickle down from the hills are
lined with ferns and forget-me nots, and elsewhere may be seen flowers
of every hue&mdash;red Alpine catchfly, blue meadow cranesbill,
hawksweed, wild radis, and a score of other pretty things.</p>
<p>But the greatest joy of all is the sight of a wide marsh covered
with the delicious <i lang="no">multeb&aelig;r</i>, whose luscious,
yellow fruit and gold-red leaves brighten the country-side. This is the
cloudberry, found in Scotland and in the North of England, and to come
on a stretch of this fruit after a long, hot walk is a thing worth
living for. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>Besides this best of all Norse wild fruits, the
fjelds produce many excellent berries, such as crowberries,
whortleberries, marsh whortleberries, bearberries, dewberries,
cranberries, and others. The children of the country parts all over
Norway spend much of their time in feasting on these little fruits, and
during the summer and autumn months their hands and faces are generally
well stained with the dark juice.</p>
<p>Upwards, beyond these pleasant pastures, when you have left behind
the last s&aelig;ter-shanty and the last thicket of birches, you reach
a world where, except for the scattered Tourist Club huts and their
summer caretakers, you cannot count on coming across either dwelling or
human being.</p>
<p>Wandering far afield, you may meet a couple of Lapps with their herd
of reindeer, and down by one of the tarns you may chance on a rough
stone shelter, inhabited for the time being by two Norwegian fishermen,
whose nets are laid in the mountain lake.</p>
<p>All over this lofty wilderness the snow lies deep for several months
of the year, but as soon as it begins to thaw it disappears rapidly,
when, as in Switzerland, Nature&rsquo;s garden immediately blossoms
forth in all its glory. It must be confessed, however, that the carpet
of Alpine flowers on the Norwegian high-fjelds cannot compare with that
of Switzerland. On the great mountain plateau of Norway everything
gives way to the lichen-like reindeer moss, and the flowers are merely
in patches, or growing in masses only in those swampy parts where the
moss does not thrive.</p>
<p>The fjelds furnish a recreation-ground for the Norwegian townsman.
There he can lead the life that he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47"
href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>loves best, and one week of the
wilds will set him up for the remainder of the year. Even though he
cares nothing for shooting or fishing, the sense of freedom as he does
his daily tramp delights his soul. And his wife or his sister as often
as not will accompany him, for the Norwegian ladies are brave walkers,
and know how to rough it.</p>
<p>But the majority of Norsemen are good sportsmen and good fishermen,
and in most seasons there are plenty of fjeld-ryper to be shot and good
hauls of trout to be made in the mountain lakes and connecting
streams.</p>
<p>But what is the country like up here on the very summit of
everything? It is called a plateau; but that does not mean that it is
absolutely level, for, as a matter of fact, there is no part of it
level enough to be made into a football ground. It is all up and down,
and every here and there are low hills, with occasionally great
prominent, rounded mountain-tops, rising to a height of 500 or 600 feet
above the plateau. Then there are chains of lakes, often several miles
in length, acres of swampy ground in every direction, shallow ravines
filled with a jumble of rocks and boulders, and constant sand mounds,
partly overgrown with grass and dwarf juniper. And up here are the
snowfields, about which we shall have more to say presently.</p>
<p>It is all weird and wild and wonderful, and if there be no wind the
silence is intense, and only broken by the bark of an Arctic fox from
some rocky hillside or by the plaintive call of a golden plover.</p>
<p>Why, it may be asked, should anyone wish to go to such a desolate
place? Only to shoot or to fish, to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48"
href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>gather in a store of the purest
air in the world, or perhaps to enjoy a period of calm and quiet
solitude&mdash;world-forgetting, by the world forgot.</p>

<h2 class="label">Chapter X</h2>
<h2 class="main">Wild Nature&mdash;Beasts</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a country like Norway, with its vast forests and
waste moorlands, it is only natural to find a considerable variety of
animals and birds. Some of these are peculiar to Scandinavia. Some,
though only occasionally met with in the British Isles, are not rare in
Norway; whilst others (more especially among the birds) are equally
common in both countries.</p>
<p>There was a time when the people of England lived in a state of fear
and dread of the ravages of wolves and bears, and the Norwegians of the
country districts even now have to guard their flocks and herds from
these destroyers. Except in the forest tracts of the Far North,
however, bears are not numerous, but in some parts, even in the South,
they are sufficiently so to be a nuisance, and are ruthlessly hunted
down by the farmers. As far as wolves are concerned civilization is,
fortunately, driving them farther afield each year, and only in the
most out-of-the-way parts are they ever encountered nowadays. Stories
of packs of hungry wolves following in the wake of a sleigh are still
told to the children in Norway, but they relate to bygone
times&mdash;half a century or more ago, and such wild excitements no
longer enter into the Norsemen&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>Yet less ferocious animals give the people trouble <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>enough,
and amongst these may be mentioned the lynx and the wolverine, or
glutton, each of which will make his supper off a sheep or a goat if he
gets the chance. Of the two the lynx is perhaps the worse poacher, and
his proverbial sharpness renders him difficult to catch. Not so the
glutton, who, if he succeeds in crawling through a hole in the fence of
a sheepfold, stuffs himself so full that he cannot get out again. I
think that most of us would rather be called lynx-eyed than gluttonous,
and certainly a lynx is a much handsomer beast than a glutton.</p>
<p>With the exception of the rabbit, all our English animals are found
in Norway&mdash;the badger, fox, hare, otter, squirrel, hedgehog,
polecat, stoat, and the rest of them. But besides these there are
little Arctic foxes and Arctic hares, with bluish-grey coats in the
summer and snowy-white ones in the winter. This change of colour is a
provision of Nature, rendering these particular animals, and some birds
also, almost invisible among the snows. The ermine is another instance
of this. In summer he is just an ugly little brown stoat; but in winter
he comes out in pure white, with a jet-black tip to his tail, a skin
worth a lot of money.</p>
<p>Of all these small Norwegian animals perhaps the most interesting is
the lemming, who, for some reason best known to himself, does not
trouble to put on a white coat in the winter, but keeps to his stripy
jacket all the year round. He lives everywhere&mdash;up on the
mountains and down in the valleys, and is hardly as large as an
ordinary rat; but woe betide the dog that brings him to bay, for if he
finds his road to escape barred, he will sit up and fight to the death,
and he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>knows how to bite. Yet he would much rather run
away if he could, as in ordinary life he is quite peacefully inclined,
and feeds on nothing more than grass and herbs and roots.</p>
<p>But there is a peculiarity about the lemming which makes the
country-folk of Norway more afraid of him than of any other animal. In
most years you may wander about the country for weeks and never see a
lemming, but occasionally there comes what is called a
&ldquo;lemming-year,&rdquo; when more young lemmings are born than
usual, and then the trouble begins. They eat up everything round about
their homes, and they begin to wander in search of food in packs of
thousands, like swarms of locusts. The farmers try to destroy them, but
they soon give up the attempt, as for days and days the lemmings come
on in great waves, eating up the grass and the crops wherever they
pass. Except the sea, nothing will stop them when once they have made a
start; they come down the mountain-sides, swim the rivers and streams,
rush through the forests, and, eating as they go, devastate the
farm-lands. They do not wander hither and thither, but keep to the same
direction straight ahead, until they eventually reach the sea. Whether
they think that it is only another river to be crossed, or whether they
think that they have done enough damage for one lifetime, nobody knows;
but into the sea they all plunge madly, and, of course, are soon
drowned.</p>
<p>This, however, does not end the nuisance, for thousands of them die
as they sweep over the country, leaving their dead bodies to poison the
water, and thus making the people ill with what they term
&ldquo;lemming <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>fever.&rdquo; So the pretty little lemmings are on
occasions more to be dreaded than are even bears and wolves, but
fortunately &ldquo;lemming-years&rdquo; do not come round very often,
and the whole country is not visited by the pest at the same time. They
made their last big raid in several districts in 1902, and they may
come swarming down from the mountains again any summer.</p>
<p>I must now say something about the wild animals which are helpful to
the people in that they provide them with food and bring money to their
pockets. Foxes and other fur-bearing animals will always fetch good
prices. There are also the hares, especially the white ones, which are
shot and snared in winter-time in great quantities, and sold all over
Europe. You may see them hanging up in the poulterers&rsquo; shops in
London. Then there is that huge beast, the elk, almost as big as a
small horse, who roams about the forests like his Canadian brother, the
moose, and is hunted and shot for his flesh, skin, and massive flat
horns. Red deer there are also in some parts of Norway; but the animal
of greatest interest is undoubtedly the reindeer.</p>
<p>Up on the great mountain plateaux there are still plenty of wild
reindeer roaming about in large herds, and numbers of them are shot
every autumn by the farmers, who sell the skins, and dry the meat to be
eaten in the winter months. It is, however, the so-called tame reindeer
which are so invaluable to the people of the North. Without them it
would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Laplanders to exist, and
without them thousands of Norwegians would be poor indeed.</p>
<p>It is a popular idea that, in the winter, reindeer draw <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>the
sleighs all over Norway. As a matter of fact, it is only in the extreme
North, among the Lapps, that reindeer are employed for this kind of
work; and very few Europeans ever have the opportunity of enjoying a
drive in a reindeer &ldquo;pulk,&rdquo; as the queer sleigh is called.
That the experience is most exhilarating and exciting is certain. In
the first place, there is only one trace, connecting a kind of shoulder
harness with the forepart of the sleigh; again, there is only one rein
coming from a collar round the deer&rsquo;s neck, and consequently
driving a reindeer as we drive a horse is, of course, out of the
question. All that it is possible to do is to head him in the required
direction, and hope for the best. A jerk of the rein sets him going;
and, as often as not, he starts at a frantic gallop, kicking up the
snow into the driver&rsquo;s face until he is almost blinded, and
careering right and left at his own sweet will until he is tired. There
is no difficulty about keeping to the road, because there are no
roads&mdash;only miles and miles of snow, and the reindeer knows pretty
well which way to go, since the camping-places and habitations in these
regions are limited.</p>
<p>Imagine what it would be like to jump into a boat-like
&ldquo;pulk&rdquo; all alone&mdash;for there is only room for
one&mdash;twist the rein round your wrist, give it a flick, and so away
over the waste of snow, watching the great antlers of the deer in front
of you, and flinging yourself from side to side to prevent capsizing.
And, if you do happen to upset, you must hang on to the rein like grim
death and be dragged over the snow, otherwise the reindeer will either
fly like the wind and be lost, or he may turn on you and attack you
with his fore-hoofs. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53"
name="pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>These are the animals which are called the tame reindeer, but their
tameness only consists in the fact that they are kept in herds
together, and watched by men and dogs. They graze wherever they choose,
and the men and the dogs have to follow them. When they are wanted for
driving, to be milked, or to be killed, the Lapp has to lasso them over
the horns, from a distance of thirty or forty yards, for no reindeer is
ever sufficiently tame to permit a man to walk up to him.</p>
<p>The wealth of a Laplander depends on the number of reindeer which he
possesses. They carry his baggage and draw his sleighs when encampments
are moved; they provide him with milk and cheese, and, when killed,
with excellent meat. Their skins keep him warm at night, and out of
them are made boots, shoes, and leggings, as well as every kind of
article of leather which the Lapp has a use for. Horns, hoofs, and
bones all have their value, and not so long ago the women did all their
sewing with needles and threads made out of reindeer&rsquo;s bones and
sinews. Moreover, after supplying their own wants, the herdsmen can
sell the surplus meat and skins, and thus obtain the wherewithal to buy
other necessaries or luxuries.</p>
<p>Cows, horses, sheep, goats, or pigs would be out of place in
Lapland, and would find nothing to eat. But the &ldquo;camel of the
Arctic Desert,&rdquo; as the reindeer has been called, thrives in the
cold without care or shelter, and subsists on the moss, which he
obtains by scraping deep holes in the snow. Small wonder that he is a
valuable beast to the Laplander, who, however, repays him only with
blows and lashes.</p>
<p>Farther south, on the Hardanger Fjeld and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>elsewhere, herds of tame reindeer have now been
established by Norwegian companies as a new industry. Lapps are hired
to look after them, and the meat is sold in great quantities in many
parts of Europe, especially in Paris. A good trade is done also in the
skins, for glove-making and other purposes. It is by no means difficult
to have a look at one of these herds, and any visitor to Norway who
finds himself within a day&rsquo;s climb of the mountains whereon a
herd is known to be grazing should do his utmost to see the reindeer.
He will find them not, like the deer in Richmond Park, waiting to be
looked at, but timid and restless, and ready to take flight at the
slightest provocation. Only the Lapp herdsmen and their dogs are able
to control these wild children of a wild land.</p>

<h2 class="main">Wild Nature&mdash;Birds</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What a place Norway must be for birds&rsquo;-nesting!
There, if one went at the right time, and did not mind roughing it, one
might find eggs which one could never come across in England, although
laid by birds which are called British. But the Norwegians protect a
great many of their birds by law in the same way as we do, and if this
had only been done a hundred years ago the Great Auk would not have
disappeared for ever.</p>
<p>Most of our British birds are found in Norway at some time of the
year, and many of our rarer birds are almost common in
Norway&mdash;golden eagles, snowy owls, ravens, ring-ouzels, and
crested tits, for instance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href=
"#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>As with us, there are resident birds
and migratory birds. Nearly all the kinds of birds which come from the
South in the summer months to nest in the British Isles also go farther
North and nest in Norway. You will find swallows, martins, cuckoos,
warblers, and others of our summer birds all nesting over there, and
you will find some varieties of southern birds which do not come to
England, but go straight up from Eastern or Central Europe to breed in
the cool of the North. Amongst these may be mentioned the blue-throated
warbler, ortolan bunting, Lapland bunting, shore lark, red-throated
pipit, tree warbler, and many others.</p>
<p>Then there are birds which are common enough in England in the
winter, but which mostly go away to Norwegian breeding-grounds, such as
geese, ducks, woodcock, and snipe; while bramblings, fieldfares, and
redwings are birds of the North, and never nest in Great Britain.
Besides these, there are a certain number of birds which have no claim
to be termed British, and which are found in Norway all the year
round&mdash;the nut-cracker, several kinds of woodpecker, the ryper
(the game-bird of the country), and others. And, on the other hand,
some of our common resident birds migrate from Norway in the
winter.</p>
<p>The house-sparrow is as much at home in Norway as he is in every
other land, but in winter he sticks close to the habitations, and were
it not for the fact that the people are bird-lovers, sparrows would
have a poor chance of picking up a living at this time of the year.
Towards the end of autumn it is a general custom to erect near the
house a sheaf of corn on a pole, so that the small birds may have
something to eat <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>when the hard weather comes. And the ceremony of
putting up the pole is made the occasion for a feast for the children.
They are thus not likely to forget the birds, and even in the towns one
sees these bundles of corn hanging outside the windows.</p>
<p>It is, perhaps, a little disappointing to find that robins in Norway
are not associated with Christmas, but the fact remains that they are
not brave enough to risk starvation, and though a few of them are said
to stay in the country, the bulk of them leave in September. But the
wren takes the place of the robin as far as tameness and impertinence
are concerned, as in winter he attaches himself to the peasant&rsquo;s
cottage and makes himself quite at home, being known either as
&ldquo;Peter-of-the-Afternoon&rdquo; or as &ldquo;Tommy-round-the
House.&rdquo; Magpies also are great favourites with the country people
at this season, as they become quite tame, and hop in and out of the
cottages. They are regularly fed, and no one would dream of molesting
them.</p>
<p>The Norwegians have several quaint old legends connected with some
of their birds. This is the story of the gold-crest, known in Norway as
the &ldquo;bird king&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time the golden eagle determined to be publicly
acknowledged as king of the birds, and he called a meeting of every
kind of bird in the world. As many of the birds would come from
tropical countries, he appointed a day in the warmest month; and the
place he chose was a vast tract called Gr&ouml;nfjeld, where every
species of bird would feel at home, since it bordered on the sea, yet
was well provided with trees, shrubs, flowers, rocks, sand, and
heather, as well <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>as with lakes and rivers full of fish. So on the
morning of the great congress the birds began to arrive in a steady
stream, and by noon every description of bird was
represented&mdash;even the ostrich (though how he contrived to cross
the seas the story does not say). The eagle welcomed them, and when the
last hummingbird had settled down he addressed the meeting, saying that
there was no doubt that he had a right to demand to be proclaimed their
king. The spread of his wings was prodigious, he could fearlessly look
at the sun, and to whatever height he soared he could detect the
slightest movement of a fly on the earth. But the birds objected to him
on account of his predatory habits, and then each in turn stated his
own case as a claimant for the kingship&mdash;the ostrich could run the
fastest, the bird of paradise and the peacock could look the prettiest,
the parrot could talk the best, the canary could sing the sweetest, and
every one of them, for some reason or other, was in his own opinion
superior to his fellows. After several days of fruitless discussion it
was finally decided that whichever bird could soar the highest should
be, once and for all, proclaimed king.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure p57width" id="p57"><img src="images/p57.jpg" alt=
"Bondhus Glacier, Hardanger Fjord" width="720" height="509">
<p class="figureHead">Bondhus Glacier, Hardanger Fjord</p>
<p class="first"><i>Page <a href="#pb63" class=
"pageref">63</a>.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Every bird who could fly at all tried his best, and the
golden eagle, confident of success, waited till last. Eventually he
spread his wings, and as he did so an impudent little gold-crest hopped
(unbeknown to his great rival) on to his back. Up went the eagle, and
soon outdistanced every other bird. Then, when he had almost reached
the sun, he shouted out, &lsquo;Well, here I am, the highest of
all!&rsquo; &lsquo;Not so,&rsquo; answered the gold-crest, as, leaving
the eagle&rsquo;s back, he fluttered <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>upwards, until suddenly
he knocked his head against the sun and set fire to his crest. Stunned
by the shock, the little upstart fell headlong to the ground, but, soon
recovering himself, he immediately flew up on to the royal rock and
showed the golden crown which he had assumed. Unanimously he was
proclaimed <i lang="no">fuglekongen</i> (king of the birds), and by
this name,&rdquo; concludes the legend, &ldquo;he has ever since been
known, his sunburnt crest remaining as a proof of his cunning and
daring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In those parts of Norway where the gold-crest is rarely seen the
same story, omitting the part about the sun and the burnt crest, is
told of the common wren, who is said to have broken off his tail in his
great fall. And to this is applied a moral, viz.: Proud and ambitious
people sometimes meet with an unexpected downfall.</p>
<p>Besides the three British woodpeckers, there are four other kinds
resident in Norway, and of these the great black woodpecker is the
largest. The woodmen consider it to be a bird which brings bad luck,
and avoid it as much as possible. They call it &ldquo;Gertrude&rsquo;s
Bird&rdquo; because of the following legend: &ldquo;Our Saviour once
called on an old woman who lived all alone in a little cottage in an
extensive forest in Norway. Her name was Gertrude, and she was a hard,
avaricious old creature, who had not a kind word for anybody, and
although she was not badly off in a worldly point of view, she was too
stingy and selfish to assist any poor wayfarer who by chance passed her
cottage door. One day our Lord happened to come that way, and, being
hungry and thirsty, he asked of Gertrude a morsel of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>bread to
eat and a cup of cold water to drink. But no, the wicked old woman
refused, and turned our Saviour from the door with revilings and
curses. Our Lord stretched forth His hand towards the aged crone, and,
as a punishment, she was immediately transformed into a black
woodpecker; and ever since that day the wicked old creature has
wandered about the world in the shape of a bird, seeking her daily
bread from wood to wood and from tree to tree.&rdquo; The red head of
the bird is supposed to represent the red nightcap worn by
Gertrude.</p>
<p>Legends of this description were doubtless introduced in the early
days of Christianity in order to impress the new religion on the
people, and several have been preserved. Thus the turtle-dove is
revered as a bird which spoke kind words to our Lord on the cross; and,
similarly, the swallow is said to have perched upon the cross and to
have commiserated with Him; while the legend of the crossbill relates
how its beak became twisted in endeavouring to withdraw the nails, and
how to this day it bears upon its plumage the red blood-stains from the
cross.</p>
<p>Yet one more Christian legend&mdash;about the lapwing, or peewit:
&ldquo;The lapwing was at one time a hand-maiden of the Virgin Mary,
and stole her mistress&rsquo;s scissors, for which she was transformed
into a bird, and condemned to wear a forked tail resembling scissors.
Moreover, the lapwing was doomed for ever and ever to fly from tussock
to tussock, uttering the plaintive cry of &lsquo;<span lang="no">Tyvit!
tyvit!</span>&rsquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.,</i> &lsquo;Thief!
thief!&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the old Viking times, before Christianity had found its way so
far North, the bird which influenced <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>the people most was the
raven. He was credited with much knowledge, as well as with the power
to bring good or bad luck. One of the titles of Odin was
&ldquo;Raven-god,&rdquo; and he had as messengers two faithful ravens,
&ldquo;who could speak all manner of tongues, and flew on his behests
to the uttermost parts of the earth.&rdquo; In those days the figure of
a raven was usually emblazoned on shield and standard, and it was
thought that as the battle raged victory or defeat could be foreseen by
the attitude assumed by the embroidered bird on the standard. And it is
well known that William the Conqueror (who came of Viking stock) flew a
banner with raven device at the Battle of Hastings.</p>
<p>But the greatest use of all to which the sable bird was put was to
guide the roving pirates on their expeditions. Before a start was made
a raven was let loose, and the direction of his flight gave the Viking
ships their course. In this manner, according to the old Norse legends,
did Floki discover Iceland; and many other extraordinary things
happened under the auspices of the raven.</p>

<p class="first">A really fine waterfall is a most fascinating thing.
Long before you reach it you hear the roar of the water, and see the
spray ascending like steam from a boiling caldron. Then when you stand
before it, you gaze in wonder on the never-ending rush of water,
hurtling in one great mass from top to bottom of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>lofty
cliff, or leaping in mighty bounds from ledge to ledge.</p>
<p>Nowhere in Europe can one see such a variety of waterfalls as in
Norway, for every district has its <i lang="no">fos</i>, and in some
districts the cascades are innumerable. In the Romsdal, for instance,
an English traveller once counted within a mile no fewer than
seventy-three waterfalls, &ldquo;none of which were less than 1,000
feet high, while some plunged down 2,000 feet.&rdquo; But the majority
of these would only consist of a single thread of water, not of that
great, broad sheet which is the feature of the more famous falls.</p>
<p>Which of Norway&rsquo;s many waterfalls is the finest is a matter of
opinion. Some people give the palm to the Rjukanfos (Telemarken), some
to the Skj&aelig;ggedalsfos<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1153src" href=

V&ouml;ringfos, while others maintain that the Vettifos, the Tvindefos,
and the Tyssedalsfos are without rivals. The fact is that each of these
(and other falls which could be named) has its own particular charm,
and the last one visited always seems to be the best. A great deal also
depends on the time of year, and on the amount of snow which has fallen
on the mountains during the preceding winter. For, it must be
remembered, it is the rapid melting of the snow in the spring that
gives to most of the Norwegian waterfalls such a volume of water in the
early months of the year.</p>
<p>But the summer rainfall on the high fjelds is always heavy, and even
after all the snow of the year has melted, an immense amount of water
has to drain away to the lowlands, and so to the sea. At first it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>collects in the tarns which fill the hollows of
the mountain plateaux, but these, overflowing, soon send their surplus
water by certain channels away over the cliffs.</p>
<p>The greater waterfalls, however, are those which indirectly carry
off the water from the snowfields, the mountains capped with perpetual
snow; for, except during the frost-bound months of winter, these falls
are always full.</p>
<p>The snowfields are of themselves of immense interest, but so
intimately are they connected with the glaciers that we shall speak of
the two together. A snowfield may exist without a glacier, but a
glacier cannot exist without a snowfield&mdash;that is to say, the
glacier is made by the snowfield.</p>
<p>How snowfields came into existence nobody knows for certain, but it
is generally supposed by learned people who have studied the matter
that, thousands of years ago, after what is called the Great Ice Age,
Norway gradually put off her mantle of ice and snow and became what she
is now; but the snow on the higher parts of the land has never yet had
time to melt right away, because fresh snow is always falling and
adding to the pile. And it is the weight of all this fresh snow on the
top of the accumulation of centuries which produces the glaciers.</p>
<p>The Folgefond, in the Hardanger district, is the snowfield which
most people who visit Norway see sooner or later, and since it covers
an area of 120 square miles, at a height of about 5,500 feet above the
sea, it is visible from a great many points of view. It forms a
background to many a picture of the varied scenery of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>Hardanger Fjord, and it has the advantage of being
easily accessible.</p>
<p>Of course, the belief in the old popular legends is dying out even
in Norway, but there are still some aged grandfathers and grandmothers
living near the great snowfield who can tell the tales as they were
told to them. Thus they relate that where the Folgefond now lies was
once a fertile and well-peopled valley, called Folgedalen, and that in
one night its farms, forests, people, and cattle were buried in snow as
a judgment for some great sin. One story ascribes the misfortune to the
curse of a gipsy woman, who had been refused alms by the priest; while
another relates that the valley was overwhelmed because the inhabitants
had murdered their liege lord, the petty King of the district.</p>
<p>But why it happened and how it happened does not really much matter,
for there the vast field of snow is to-day, and there it will doubtless
remain for many centuries to come. As has been said, you can go up to
the top of it and sleigh across a portion of its summit, or you can
potter round about it and examine its many glaciers.</p>
<p>The two largest glaciers of the Folgefond are the Buar Br&aelig;,
near Odda, and the Bondhus Br&aelig;, near Sundal, and to spend a day
at either of them is a real treat. But it is not wise to visit these
glaciers without someone who knows them, for one might easily fall into
one of the great fissures in the ice, known as crevasses, especially if
lately-fallen snow had hidden the opening of the mighty crack.</p>
<p>A glacier, as most people know (now that everyone <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>goes to
Switzerland, if not to Norway), is nothing more than a river of ice;
not a nice, clean, smooth sheet of ice, but a rough mass of frozen
billows, almost blue in colour, and generally covered with sand, dust,
and stones of all sizes. Wherever, beneath the edge of a snowfield, the
country shapes itself into a valley, there you will find a glacier.</p>
<p>If you make a snowball, and keep pressing and kneading it in your
hands, you will soon convert it into a solid lump of ice. That is just
what the sun does to the snowfield. It keeps melting the new snow, and
this presses down into the old snow, so that the weight of the whole
thing squeezes out the frozen snow into the valleys in the form of
glaciers. And, as this process goes on year after year, the glacier
would naturally keep going lower and lower down into the valley were it
not for the fact that the point (or snout, as it is termed) of the
glacier very frequently breaks off, and disappears into the torrent of
ice-water which flows away from it. So some glaciers, although always
moving, never grow any longer, but others creep a little bit farther
down each year.</p>
<div class="figure p64width" id="p64"><img src="images/p64.jpg" alt=
"L&aelig;rdals&ouml;ren" width="720" height="498">
<p class="figureHead">L&aelig;rdals&ouml;ren</p>
<p class="first"><i>Page <a href="#pb70" class=
"pageref">70</a>.</i></p>
</div>
<p>There are many other interesting things about a glacier. One of them
is the moraine, which consists of heaps of rocks and stones broken off
from the edges of the valley by the great river of ice as it pushes its
way imperceptibly forward. These rocks are embedded in the ice or borne
on its surface, and are only given up when the extremity of the glacier
melts away into the torrent. Some of the rocks thus transported are of
immense weight, and the torrent is powerless to move them; year by
year, therefore, the jumbled heap of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>boulders and rocks is
added to until it often grows to an enormous size.</p>
<p>Another fine snowfield in the Hardanger district is the J&ouml;kul,
a splendid white dome, whose melting snows help to swell the
V&ouml;ringfos. The J&ouml;kul does not possess many large glaciers,
but one of them has, in past years, been a great source of trouble to
the people who live near it. This is the Rembesdal glacier, at the far
end of the Simodal Valley, near Eidfjord.</p>
<p>The Simodal is a beautiful and fertile valley, with farms on either
bank of the river, which rushes through it to the fjord. This river
comes from the glacier, but not directly. The head of the valley is
choked by a high cliff, over which tumbles a grand waterfall, and this
issues from a large mountain lake, into the opposite end of which
descends the snout of the glacier, with a continuous stream of milky
water flowing from it. So far there is nothing peculiar in all this,
but the peculiarity lies higher up.</p>
<p>Some little distance up the glacier, and almost at right angles to
one side of it, is a rocky hollow or small valley, and into this the
water begins to pour in the spring as soon as the sun is strong enough
to begin to melt the snow. The great glacier blocks up the end of this
hollow with a thick dam of ice, and before long a huge lake is
formed.</p>
<p>What used to happen every two or three years was that the pressure
of the water in this dammed-up lake became so tremendous that the
glacier at last could resist it no longer. Away went the side and lower
part of the glacier, and with one mighty crash the water escaped. Down
into the lower lake, and over the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66"
href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>waterfall, the wall of solid
water, several feet in height, descended into the valley. There it
carried destruction far and wide, sweeping away crops, cattle, farm
buildings, bridges, and everything that came in its way. The loss of
life also was often considerable, for there was no warning other than
the roar of the water as it burst into the valley.</p>
<p>A few years ago, however, some Norwegian engineers devised a means
of averting these terrible floods by enabling the upper lake to empty
itself gradually. They constructed under the glacier an iron-lined
tunnel, connecting the upper lake with the lower, and in this way the
water escaped at once. So the people of Simodal can now sleep in
peace.</p>

<h2 class="main">Driving in Norway</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Like Switzerland, Norway has splendid roads. No
difficulty in road-making seems to be too great for the Norwegian
engineers to overcome. One frequently sees miles of road cut out of the
solid rock of some mountain-side, and skirting the edge of a fjord or
long lake. Again, a road may wind its way through a narrow gorge, with
precipices a thousand feet high on either hand, and down in the depths
a wild torrent, crossed every here and there by massive stone bridges;
or, over the open mountains a road will zigzag upwards to a pass in
long loops, like the famous &ldquo;Snake Road&rdquo; near
R&ouml;ldal.</p>
<p>And the surface of all these roads is hard and kept in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>good
repair&mdash;at any rate, in the summer months. In the winter they are,
of course, thick in snow, which, when beaten down by the sleigh
traffic, forms a new surface, which takes the wear and tear off the
actual roadway for several months.</p>
<p>But we are now writing of the summer, after the snow has all melted,
the snow-ploughs put on one side, and the roads recovered from the
havoc wrought by the streams of melting snow. Then the sleighs have
been hidden away in the innermost recesses of barns and outhouses, and
the driving season begins.</p>
<p>Driving is one of the greatest enjoyments of Norwegian travel,
though too much of it is perhaps wearisome. The best plan is to arrange
a tour, so that some of it shall be by railway, some by steamer, some
walking, and some driving, and this is generally easy to manage. The
particular charm of driving is that the traveller can take his own
time, go his own pace, and stop when and where he chooses. In this
manner the scenery is capable of being more fully appreciated.</p>
<p>Until quite recently there were very few railways in Norway, and
there are not many now. There are, however, plenty of excellent roads,
and a well-organized system of posting. The posting-stations are
situated about ten miles apart, and consist usually of a small inn or
farmhouse, where the traveller can demand food and lodgings, as well as
a change of conveyance and horses. The <i lang="no">skydsgut</i>
(literally post-boy, but frequently an old man, or even a woman),
accompanies the conveyance from his station to the next, and returns
with it, though nowadays it is more usual to engage a vehicle (if not
also a horse or pony) for a whole day&rsquo;s journey, which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>has the advantage of avoiding the perpetual
rearrangement of one&rsquo;s luggage.</p>
<p>There are four kinds of conveyance in general use: the <i lang=
"no">cal&egrave;che</i>, drawn by a pair of horses, and something like
a heavily-built victoria; the <i lang="no">trille</i>, a light,
four-wheeled trap with two horses; and the <i lang=
"no">stolkj&aelig;rre</i> and the <i>carriole</i>, the last two being
the most popular and convenient vehicles for quick travelling.</p>
<p>The <i lang="no">stolkj&aelig;rre</i> is a rough, box-like cart,
with a seat for two persons, and another little seat behind for the
<i lang="no">skydsgut</i>. It has the advantages of ample room for
luggage, and economy when travelling two together, the hire of one
<i lang="no">stolkj&aelig;rre</i> being less than that of two
<i>carrioles</i>; but, having no springs, it jolts and jars its
occupants most unmercifully.</p>
<p>The <i>carriole</i> may be considered to be the national vehicle of
Norway, and is certainly the most comfortable. In appearance it
resembles a miniature buggy, and it holds one person, who can stretch
his legs in a long, narrow trough between the seat and the
splash-board; or, by straddling the trough, the occupant can rest his
feet on two conveniently-placed iron steps. The luggage is strapped on
to a board behind, and the <i lang="no">skydsgut</i> sits on it. A
day&rsquo;s drive in a <i>carriole</i>, if the weather be fine and the
pony a good one, is a real pleasure, and an intelligent <i lang=
"no">skydsgut</i> will enliven the journey with his amusing babble, as
well as with scraps of information about the country traversed.</p>
<p>The ponies are generally about thirteen hands in height,
good-tempered, sure-footed, strong, and hardy, and think nothing of
doing thirty or forty miles a day, if given an occasional rest. Driving
them requires no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>great skill, and it is best to leave them as much
as possible to their own devices, since reins and bit have very little
influence over their movements. One may haul on to the reins for half
an hour without inducing the pony to pull up, but the magic sound of
the &ldquo;burr-r-r&rdquo; uttered by the <i lang="no">skydsgut</i>
will cause the little beast to stop dead. And he will not go on again
until he hears the peculiar click of his master&rsquo;s tongue. So the
stranger in the <i>carriole</i> or <i lang="no">stolkj&aelig;rre</i>
will do well to hold the reins for the sake of appearances, and allow
his <i lang="no">skydsgut</i> to do the rest.</p>
<p>One word of comfort to the adventurous driver: Do not be alarmed if
you notice that the harness is dropping to pieces. Your henchman (up
behind) will soon put matters right with some scraps of string and a
few bits of stick.</p>
<p>But the actual drive&mdash;how lovely it all is! Now you are passing
up a valley among the hayfields and orchards which border the river,
and by the roadside you find a profusion of wild flowers&mdash;great
purple gentians, blue harebells, yellow mountain globe flowers, and
other blossoms of varied colours. Butterflies there are also in
abundance, and, if you be an entomologist, your heart will rejoice at
the sight of such rare English insects as the Camberwell Beauty, the
Northern Brown, and others. Now you enter a dark pine-forest, to find
yourself before long emerging on to an open stretch of wild moorland;
and so you cross the col, and commence to drop down into another
valley, narrow and shut in by towering mountains. Waterfalls sparkle in
the sun as they tumble over the cliffs, and the still unmelted snow
stands out white and glistering on the distant <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>hill-tops. The road swings from side to side of
the valley, crossing the torrent in its bottom by stout timber bridges,
and at last you reach the margin of the great lake, where stands the
neat little inn ready to provide you with your midday meal.</p>
<p>The organized tours, however short they be, always include a drive
of this description, and no Englishman would consider that he had
visited Norway unless he had driven through a part of the country. Even
in a week one can cover a deal of ground. One can go by steamer from
Bergen up the Hardanger Fjord to Eide, and thence drive across the neck
of land to the Sogne Fjord, through the finest and most varied scenery
imaginable, returning to Bergen, if needs be, by steamer down the Sogne
Fjord. Or, if there be a few days to spare, one can steam across the
head of the Sogne Fjord from Gudvangen to L&aelig;rdals&ouml;ren, and
thence again take <i>carriole</i> or <i lang="no">stolkj&aelig;rre</i>
to the Fillefjeld, and so visit the wildest of Norway&rsquo;s mountain
districts, the Jotunheim&mdash;the Home of the Giants.</p>

<h2 class="label">Chapter XIV</h2>
<h2 class="main">Arctic Days and Nights</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Everyone has read of the midnight sun and of the
sunless winter of the North. They are features of all tales of Arctic
exploration. Yet, in order to see the sun shining at midnight or to
experience pitch-dark days, it is not necessary to be actually a seeker
after the North Pole. Sunny nights and black winter days <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>may be
enjoyed, or otherwise, even in Norway, but only in the Far
North&mdash;within the Arctic Circle.</p>
<p>It is not quite easy to realize what things are like right away up
in the North, as it were, on the top of the world, and why things are
as they are is difficult to explain without entering into a host of
scientific details. We will, therefore, avoid a long discussion about
the movements of the earth and suchlike matters, and merely mention
certain facts. At the North Pole itself there is continuous day for six
months of the year, and continuous night for the other six months,
while on the line known as the Arctic Circle the sun shines at midnight
once, and once only, in the year, and during one entire day of
twenty-four hours in the winter it does not rise above the horizon at
all. South of the Arctic Circle there is no such thing as midnight sun
or as a day without sunrise.</p>
<p>As far as Norway is concerned, a considerable tract of country lies
within the Arctic Circle&mdash;in fact, an area rather larger than that
of Ireland&mdash;so it is not very difficult to find a place where the
midnight sun can be seen for a period in the summer-time, and where in
the winter some of the days are really dark. Of course, to see the
midnight sun it is necessary to be at the place selected at the right
time, and even then there is always the chance of the sky being clouded
over, and no sun visible. For the latter reason travellers with plenty
of leisure endeavour to go as far North as possible, so as to be almost
certain of seeing the great sight.</p>
<p>Nowadays everything is made easy for everybody, and steamers take
passengers to the North Cape <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href=
"#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>throughout the summer for the sole
purpose of enabling them to see the midnight sun from the very best
point of view. Here, provided that the sky is clear, the midnight sun
can be seen from May 13 to July 31. Between those dates it does not
set, and it would be a bad summer indeed if the clouds hid the sun for
so long a time.</p>
<p>To reach the North Cape takes a good deal of time, and many people
dislike a lengthy sea voyage; but even if one starts from Bergen and
goes all the way by sea, there is something of interest to be seen
every day, as the steamer keeps close to the coast, threads its way
among the innumerable small islands, and calls at many places with
beautiful scenery in the background, more especially Molde and
Christiansund.</p>
<p>A little farther on you come to Trondhjem; but if you would curtail
the sea voyage it is not necessary to take the steamer from Bergen,
since Trondhjem can be reached by rail from Christiania or by a driving
tour right through the country from various places. Onwards from
Trondhjem, however, you must go by sea, unless you are prepared for a
long and rough overland journey.</p>
<p>Trondhjem, the ancient capital of Norway, is a place of historic
interest, and contains the finest cathedral in Scandinavia. Its name
means &ldquo;throne home,&rdquo; as the old Kings of Norway used to
reside there, and it was the place where the coronation ceremony was
always performed. Though no longer the capital of the country, it is
still a flourishing town, and the present King (Haakon VII.) was
crowned there a few years ago.</p>
<p>Now the real sea voyage to the North Cape <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>commences, and with luck you may reach your
destination in five days, but on every one of the five you will stop
somewhere or see something which will be worth seeing. The town of
Namsos is of no great interest, but the coast and island scenery now
becomes stupendous and grand, with great giant rocks rising up out of
the sea. The most remarkable of these are Torghatten and
Hestmanden.</p>
<p>The peculiarity of Torghatten lies in the fact that there is a hole
or tunnel straight through the massive rock, which itself is some 800
feet in height. As you sail past it you see daylight through the hole,
and if you land to examine it you will find that it is nearly 200 yards
from end to end, and that its almost perpendicular sides vary in height
from 60 feet at one end to four times that height at the other end. No
man can account for this remarkable tunnel except by quoting the local
legend, and in this the Hestmand (the other extraordinary rocky island)
is mixed up.</p>
<div class="figure p73width" id="p73"><img src="images/p73.jpg" alt=
"A Lapp Mother and Child" width="528" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">A Lapp Mother and Child</p>
<p class="first"><i>Page <a href="#pb80" class=
"pageref">80</a>.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Hestmanden, the &ldquo;man on horseback,&rdquo; is a wonderful mass
of rock, the outline of which, allowing for a little imagination,
resembles a man on a horse. And this is the legend:</p>
<p>Not far from Torghatten is an island called Lek&ouml;, on which, in
the age of the giants, there lived a beautiful maiden. In those days
the Hestmand was a real live giant, and he fell desperately in love
with the Lek&ouml; maiden. But the latter, who was only half a
giantess, was afraid of the great monster, and would have nothing to do
with him. So the Hestmand flew into a rage, and one day chased the
object of his affections, who fled for her life. The giants did not do
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>things by halves, and the Hestmand was so angry
that he meant to kill the maiden, and he shot at her with a giant
arrow, which was a fairly large fir-tree. Now, just at the moment that
he shot his arrow, the maiden&rsquo;s brother, who was another giant,
realized what was going on, and flung his hat between his sister and
the arrow. The maiden was saved, but the arrow pierced the hat. Then
the sun suddenly appeared above the horizon, and the actors in the
tragedy were instantly turned into stone. Hestmanden is the wicked
giant on his horse; Torghatten is the hat which was pierced by the
arrow; the arrow itself may be seen, as a great stone pinnacle, on a
neighbouring island; while Lek&ouml;moen, the mountain on Lek&ouml;, is
the beautiful maiden who caused all the trouble.</p>
<p>But to continue the voyage. Immediately after passing Hestmanden the
Arctic Circle is crossed, and a few hours later a call is made at the
little town of Bod&ouml;. Thence to the Lof&ouml;dden Islands is no
great distance, and after they have been visited and the wonderful cod
drying-grounds inspected, the steamer wends its way to Troms&ouml;, and
then to Hammerfest, which we have already referred to as a great place
for the manufacture of cod-liver oil. Beyond this the rocky coast
presents a succession of rugged and wild capes and promontories until
the object of the voyage at length comes in sight.</p>
<p>The North Cape, the northernmost point of Norway, is a rocky
headland on Mager&ouml; Island&mdash;the end of all things, rising a
thousand feet above the deep blue Arctic sea. The climb up the steep,
zigzag pathway from the spot where the steamer lands you is arduous,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>and you will be glad of the rest by King
Oscar&rsquo;s column. You would have been glad if a score of other
passengers had not been with you, and still more glad if you had come
here half a century earlier, before the hand of man had marked the
spot, and before all your distant friends expected you to post them a
postcard from the North Cape.</p>
<p>Still, something of romance remains as, gazing northwards, you
remember that, except, perhaps, for a corner of Spitzbergen, nothing
intervenes between you and the North Pole&mdash;only that barrier of
ice which, so far, has defied all penetration. But this is mere
sentiment, and you have come to see something else&mdash;the merging of
sunset with sunrise. Du Chaillu well describes the scene: &ldquo;The
brilliancy of the splendid orb varies in intensity, like that of sunset
and sunrise, according to the state of moisture of the atmosphere. One
day it will be of a deep red colour, tingeing everything with a roseate
hue, and producing a drowsy effect. There are times when the changes in
the colour between the sunset and sunrise might be compared to the
variations of a charcoal fire, now burning with a fierce red glow, then
fading away, and rekindling with greater brightness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are days when the sun has a pale, whitish appearance,
and when even it can be looked at for six or seven hours before
midnight. As this hour approaches the sun becomes less glaring,
gradually changing into more brilliant shades as it dips towards the
lowest point of its course. Its motion is very slow, and for quite a
while it apparently follows the line of the horizon, during which there
seems to be a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>pause, as when the sun reaches noon. This is
midnight. For a few minutes the glow of sunset mingles with that of
sunrise, and one cannot tell which prevails; but soon the light becomes
slowly and gradually more brilliant, announcing the birth of another
day, and often before an hour has elapsed the sun becomes so dazzling
that one cannot look at it with the natural eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is the wondrous sight, and all through the summer, even before
and after the period of the non-setting of the sun, the nights are
almost as light as day. Indeed, all over Norway, far to the south of
the Arctic Circle, the summer nights are remarkably short&mdash;not
altogether an unmixed blessing to those who find it difficult to sleep
in daylight.</p>
<p>But what a change comes over these northern lands in winter! At the
North Cape the sun sets on November 18, not to rise again until January
24, and everywhere within the Arctic Circle there is a time of
continuous night. To us, who have no experience of such a state of
affairs, it seems as if life must be bereft of all its pleasures. Yet
the dwellers in the Arctic regions think nothing of it. To them even
the dark winter has its charms, for, as has been said of a certain
gentleman, it is not really as black as it has been painted.</p>
<p>In the first place, there is the snow, covering everything, and even
at the darkest time of year there is sufficient light, if the sky be
clear, to see to read for an hour before and an hour after midday. Then
there is the light given by the moon and stars, and lastly the cheering
glow of the aurora borealis, or northern <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>lights. It is not,
therefore, always dark, though when snow falls or the clouds block out
the sky the darkness becomes intense. At such times the picture is
truly a melancholy one.</p>
<p>To say that the light given by the aurora borealis does duty for
sunlight is not true. Magnificent spectacle as it presents, this
marvellous phenomenon produces no light of any real value, and only
occasionally for a few minutes does it illumine the landscape. Tales of
sleighing over the wastes of snow by the light of the aurora borealis
have no foundation in fact, for seldom, if ever, has it sufficient
power to obliterate the stars, and never does the moon pale before it.
On the other hand, it is certain that these northern lights, streaming
up into the heavens on every clear night of the long winter, must bring
feelings of pleasure to the inhabitants of the Polar regions. The form,
the intensity, and the colour of the light is ever varying, and thus,
in watching it, there is always expectancy. We in England are
accustomed to see these lights on autumn nights, but the display is
feeble in comparison with that of the Arctic winter.</p>

<h2 class="label">Chapter XV</h2>
<h2 class="main">Laplanders at Home</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Although Lapps are occasionally seen in charge of
reindeer herds on some of the southern mountain tracts of Norway, their
real home is in the Far North, not only of Norway, but also of Sweden,
Finland, and Russia, and the country which they inhabit is known as
Lapland.</p>
<p>That portion of it which belongs to Norway covers only some 3,000 or
4,000 square miles, while the whole of the Land of the Lapps has an
area of something like 35,000 square miles. But statistics show that in
Norwegian Lapland there are a great many more inhabitants than there
are in Russian, Finnish, and Swedish Lapland put together; and the
people, whether they be under the rule of Russia, Sweden, or Norway,
are all of the same race&mdash;Asiatics and Mongols&mdash;totally
unlike Europeans in appearance.</p>
<p>In the first place, they are dark, and what we consider ugly, though
it is quite possible that in their eyes we ourselves are hideous. Then
they are short&mdash;a five-foot Lapp would be almost a giant&mdash;but
what they lack in stature they make up in sturdiness; for, although
spare of body, probably no men in the world can do a longer day&rsquo;s
work, or survive greater hardships. Dirty they are certainly, since
they never change their clothes and seldom comb their hair; yet, for
all that, they are perfectly healthy and happy.</p>
<p>They have gradually split up into three groups, known as Mountain
Lapps, Sea Lapps, and River Lapps, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>first being nomads, or
wanderers, and the other two settlers, by the sea or river, who have
abandoned the original mode of life of their race.</p>
<p>Mountain Lapps are the most restless individuals it is possible to
imagine. Winter and summer they are always on the move, and three days
are seldom passed in one place. Time does not enslave them, for they do
not trouble about it. Routine is nothing to them: they eat and drink
when they feel inclined, and they sleep when a favourable opportunity
occurs. In such matters, as well as in many others, they resemble wild
animals. But in some respects they are methodical: they work by the
seasons, and in their wanderings take the same lines each year. In the
summer months they are down by the sea; during the remainder of the
year they are on the mountains, though at Christmas-time they usually
arrange to encamp somewhere in the vicinity of a church; for Christmas
is a great event in the lives of the Lapps, since they profess
Christianity, and if they are able to go to church at no other time of
the year, they make a point of doing so at this season.</p>
<p>To-day these people are law-abiding and peaceable, but they are a
strange mixture of good and bad. They are kind and hospitable, and of a
cheerful disposition; at the same time they can be cruel, cunning, and
selfish, while their love of money is no less than their love of
drink&mdash;when they can obtain it.</p>
<p>For one thing only does the Mountain Lapp live&mdash;his herd of
reindeer. They provide all his wants&mdash;food, clothing, and the
wherewithal to purchase luxuries. They are his wealth; his very
existence depends on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80"
name="pb80">80</a>]</span>them, and, in consequence, his mode of living
has to be accommodated to the habits of his reindeer. Whither-soever
they choose to graze, their owner has to follow; and he deems it no
hardship to pitch his rough tent on the snowy wastes in winter, or even
to sleep out under a rock, with the thermometer at seventy degrees
below zero. It is his life; from earliest childhood he has known none
other; he is content with it. And it is not only the men who pass their
lives thus; for the Lapp family is to some extent a united one, and the
women and children thoroughly enjoy the wild, free life, apparently
suffering no ill effects from the rigours of the climate.</p>

<p class="first"><i>Page <a href="#pb87" class=

</div>
<p>A Lapp baby starts life in a very queer way. Until it is able to
walk it is kept in what is called a <i lang="no">komse</i>, a kind of
cradle made of strips of wood covered with leather, and just large
enough to take the baby. The little creature is rolled up in sheepskin
and put into the cradle, which is then stuffed with moss, and the
leather covering laced securely all around, so that only the
baby&rsquo;s face is seen. To protect its head the <i lang=
"no">komse</i> is provided with a wooden hood, like most cradles, and
there is generally a shawl, which can be thrown over the whole thing in
severe weather; in fact, when the baby has been properly done up in its
<i lang="no">komse</i>, it might go by parcel post without coming to
much harm. It is a very excellent arrangement, because the family is
incessantly moving about, and the mothers have their work to do, so
cannot always be bothering about their babies. A thong of leather
stretches from head to foot of the <i lang="no">komse</i>, which the
mother can thus sling on her shoulder when going about, and by this
thong the baby <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>can be hung up to a tent-pole or to the branch of
a tree if its mother is busy. But as often as not the <i lang=
"no">komses</i> are just stuck up on end in the snow or against a rock
while work is going on.</p>
<p>As soon as the child can walk and has finished its cradle existence,
it is dressed in clothes similar to those of his or her father or
mother, and looks most quaint. And the life which these children lead
is devoid of much amusement. From the beginning they are helping to
pack up and move the tent, and to look after the reindeer; they are
nothing more than little old men and women; their toys are miniatures,
or models, of such things as they will have to use later in
life&mdash;lassoes, snowshoes, sleighs&mdash;and their games are
restricted to learning the use of the same. They are treated by their
parents more or less as if they were grown up, and allowed to do much
as they please. Consequently, they become self-willed, and have little
respect for their elders.</p>
<p>After all, the mode of life of the Lapps does not differ very
greatly from that of our own gipsies, though of the two the Lapps are
certainly the better people. The wandering spirit is inherent in both,
but a portion of each sooner or later shakes it off, and leads a more
settled life. Some there are, however, who will never be anything but
wanderers, so long as there remains a free country wherein they are at
liberty to roam.</p>
<p>Let us now see the kind of place which the Mountain Lapp calls
&ldquo;home.&rdquo; It cannot be anything very elaborate or bulky, as
it has to be packed up and moved about nearly every day, and it has to
be carried on the backs of the reindeer in summer, or drawn by them in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>sleighs in the winter. So it is nothing more than
a most unconventional form of tent, not altogether unlike the wigwam of
the Red Indian, or the dwelling of many other nomadic people. A few
long poles are stuck up on a circle, with their ends fastened together
to form a sort of cone, and over this framework is stretched a covering
of coarse woollen material. At one side there is a loose flap, forming
a door, and the whole of the top part of the tent round about the ends
of the poles is left open, to admit light and to allow the smoke from
the fire to issue forth. The diameter of the tent is about twelve or
fifteen feet, and the height in the centre eight or ten feet. This is
the kitchen, larder, store-room, drawing-room, dining-room, and bedroom
of the family&mdash;men, women, boys, girls, babies, dogs and all.</p>
<p>A few branches of trees are spread on the ground, and in the middle,
immediately under the opening in the roof, is the fire, which is kept
alight day and night. Around it the inmates sit on the ground by day,
and sleep by night. There is no furniture of any kind, and only a few
cooking-pots, with some wooden bowls, and spoons of wood or of horn.
Beds and blankets and suchlike luxuries are also absent, so undressing,
dressing, washing, and absurdities of that kind are not indulged in.
When the time has come to go to sleep, those who are in the tent just
roll themselves close up to the fire, and sleep quite comfortably in
the clothes which they probably have not taken off for a year or two.
The whole family is not likely to be in the tent at the same time; some
members of it must always be looking after the reindeer, as the herd
can never be left <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83"
name="pb83">83</a>]</span>to its own devices; consequently, there is
generally plenty of room.</p>
<p>Meals are free-and-easy affairs; there is no dinner-bell and no
fixed time for eating. But food is always ready, hanging in a pot over
the fire; and when anyone feels inclined to eat, the hand is plunged
into the pot, and a piece of meat pulled out and devoured. In addition
to reindeer-meat&mdash;of which the Lapps consume a great
deal&mdash;the food consists of cheese, and sometimes a kind of
porridge; while for drink they have water, melted snow, reindeer-milk,
and, on occasions, coffee. The latter they are very fond of, but few
families can afford to drink it often; so also with spirits, which,
however, they only manage to obtain in the towns.</p>
<p>Thus live the Mountain Lapps year in year out. To-day a family is in
one place, to-morrow a dozen miles away; now and again other families
are met with, and received hospitably; but for the most part the family
and its herd keep to themselves, since to do otherwise might lead to
difficulties about grazing. The rain floods their tent; the snow buries
it; the wind blows it down; yet they survive, and glory in their free
life.</p>
<p>The Sea Lapps, though much more numerous than their brethren of the
mountains, are not so interesting. They live by the coast in huts built
of wood or of sods, and obtain a livelihood by fishing. The River
Lapps, on the other hand, are both herdsmen and fishermen. Residing in
small settlements on the banks of the rivers, they keep reindeer as
well as a few cows and sheep, and they do a little in the way of
farming the land round the settlement. Many of them are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>even
intellectual, and the advantages of having their children properly
educated in the schools are gradually becoming appreciated.</p>

<h2 class="main">Winter in Christiania</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Cold it is, of course&mdash;bitterly cold, and always
freezing hard; but it is a dry cold, and you hardly notice it. The
streets are all one sheet of frozen snow, and great care is taken to
keep them in good repair, gangs of road-menders being always at hand to
fill up ruts by the simple process of picking up the hard snow of the
roadway and then sprinkling a little water on the top, which at once
produces a solid surface. No wheeled traffic is now to be seen;
everything is on runners, from the carriage of the King to the
doll&rsquo;s perambulator. One no longer hears the rumble of the
<i>carrioles</i> and <i lang="no">stolkj&aelig;rres</i> over the rough
flags, and the silence is broken only by the jingling of the
sleigh-bells.</p>
<p>It is a strange sight indeed, this winter city, with its fur-clad
men and women, and snow-covered houses and gardens, its keen, crisp air
and pale blue sky. What a change from the fogs and dampness of our
English climate!</p>
<p>Christiania is gay at this time of year, for it is the
&ldquo;season.&rdquo; The members of the Storthing, with their wives
and families, are in town for the session, and all sorts of gaieties
are in progress. But all those Norwegians who have leisure to enjoy
themselves turn their attentions to the real pleasures of
winter&mdash;sleighing, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href=
"#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>ski-ing, tobogganing, and skating.
The boys and girls are thoroughly happy. Directly school is over away
they go, with their skates, snowshoes, or toboggans, to have a right
good time in their different playgrounds. The hill on which the palace
stands is given up to these little revellers, and in the evenings
dozens of them of all ages may be seen descending the slopes face
downwards on their <i lang="no">kj&aelig;lker</i>, or racing through
the trees with their long ski on their feet. The public gardens also
are flooded to form a rink for the sole use of the infant skaters, and,
judging by their rosy cheeks, the outdoor exercise in the cold, dry air
makes them as healthy as any children in the world.</p>
<p>But grown-up people consider skating feeble sport in comparison with
ski-ing, which may be called the national sport of Norway. Not so many
years ago it was restricted to that country; but now the sport has
become a favourite one in Sweden, Switzerland, and in other parts of
Europe where the snow lies deep. Yet, to see perfection in the art, one
must go to Norway&mdash;the real home of the great long wooden
snowshoe. From earliest youth the Norwegians of both sexes are
accustomed to go about the country in the long winter months on these
strange contrivances, for without them it would be absolutely
impossible to move off the roads. Children are taught in the schools to
use them; soldiers wear them at winter drill and manoeuvres; farmers,
milkmaids, cowboys, all may be seen daily in the country parts going
from place to place on them, and so keen are the young rustic lads on
becoming proficient ski-runners that all over Norway are to be found
ski clubs, formed for the purpose of encouraging snowshoeing as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>a pastime, and for sending competitors to the
great annual meeting at Christiania.</p>
<p>These snowshoe competitions are most interesting and exciting; and
the pluck, endurance, and daring which they bring out are remarkable.
They take place on the hills just outside Christiania, and are attended
by every man, woman, and child who can reach the spot. On the first day
is held the long-distance race, and on the second the jumping
competition, only winners in the former being allowed to enter for the
latter.</p>
<p>Every English boy knows what it is to take part in a cross-country
run of half a dozen miles. The Norwegian test is something more
formidable&mdash;about fifteen miles of rough, mountainous country,
over hill and dale, through forests, and as often as not down rocky
precipices, all half buried in snow; in the runner&rsquo;s hand a
staff, and on his feet his ski, six or eight feet long. The course is
carefully marked out beforehand by tying pieces of coloured rag to
branches and rocks, and it is a point-to-point race throughout. Every
district sends its champion, and there are frequently as many as eighty
competitors, who are started one after another at intervals of a
minute. Except, however, for expert ski-runners who can follow the
course, it is not an interesting race to watch, as one only sees the
start or the finish, to learn subsequently who covered the distance in
the shortest time.</p>
<p>The appearance of the men as they come in is sufficient proof of the
terrific nature of the test. So bathed in perspiration are they that
they might have been running a &ldquo;Marathon&rdquo; race in the
height of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>summer; and so parched are their tongues that they
can scarcely speak. Lucky the skier who, during his run, chances on an
unfrozen forest pool whereat he may quench his thirst by deep draughts
of what the Norwegian terms &ldquo;goosewine&rdquo;&mdash;our
&ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s ale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the second day&rsquo;s sport is of a different kind; the whole
thing is visible to the spectators, who from first to last are
subjected to thrills of wild excitement. The ground selected for the
contest is the side of a somewhat steep hill, and the snow must be in
proper condition&mdash;deep, and not having a hard-frozen crust. The
competitors assemble on the summit, and at the bottom of the
slope&mdash;perhaps a hundred yards from the starting-point&mdash;is a
large enclosed space, around which stand the spectators. Half-way down
the hillside, a horizontal platform, well covered with hard snow, has
been built out, so as to form the &ldquo;taking-off&rdquo; point for
the long jump; and close by it is the box for the judges and committee.
The soldiers on ski, keeping the ground, give the signal that all is
ready; in another second a bugle-call resounds from the top of the
hill; and the first man has started.</p>
<p>Down the slope he comes at the top of his speed, his fists clenched,
and determination in his face. Gathering himself together as he nears
the &ldquo;take-off,&rdquo; he bends slightly on his ski, and, with a
frantic bound, flies forward into space. For an instant a breathless
silence falls on the crowd, and then, as the <i lang=
"no">ski-l&ouml;ber</i> lands at the bottom, and struggles in vain to
keep his feet, cheers mingled with laughter fill the air. Number 2 is
no more successful than his predecessor; but Number 3 lands on both
feet with much grace, continues his way <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>on level ground, and,
wheeling round, receives the well-merited applause of the onlookers.
Others follow in quick succession, some making brilliant leaps, some
having awkward spills; yet one and all racing down to the platform with
almost abandoned recklessness. What with the delay caused by accidents,
and the time taken in measuring the successful jumps, the contest
occupies some hours. Then the judges declare the names of the
prize-winners, together with the length of each man&rsquo;s leap; and,
prodigious as it may seem, it is no unusual thing for the champion to
accomplish 100 feet, measured on the slope from the
&ldquo;take-off&rdquo; to the landing-point.</p>
<p>Such are some of the winter sports of Norway. Can anyone wonder that
the men who enter into them with so great a zest have earned for
themselves the name of &ldquo;Hardy Norsemen&rdquo;? Can anyone wonder
that Dr. Nansen, in his younger days the champion <i lang=
"no">ski-l&ouml;ber</i> at one of these great meetings, should have
defeated all others in the race for the North Pole?</p>
